Now the question is whether all the leg-\\nislative measures i.e. the Proclamations, Martial -\\nLaw Regulations and Orders, were promulgated/\\nmade during the period from 15 August, 1975 upto\\nApril 9, 1979 by legally constituted authority or by\\nusurpers and if by usurper whether those legislative\\nmeasures were illegal, void and non east and\\nwhether the Second Parliament, itself, even by two\\nthird majority, could pass any law repugnant to the\\nConstitution and whether the Fifth Amendment is\\nultra vires the Constitution,', '156. As it appears the grounds on which the\\nFifth Amendment was challenged before the High\\nCourt Division are that—\\n<br>\\n(a) Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Justice\\nASM Sayem and General Zjaur Rahman\\nhaving no authority to assume the post\\nof President and Chief Martjal Law\\nAdministrators and accordingly are\\nusurpers and\\n<br>\\n(b) Fifth Amendment negates and is also', 'repugnant to the basis feature of the\\nConstitution.', '157. Regarding the point of usurpers it Was\\nargued as follows:\\n<br>\\n(i) On the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh\\nMujibur  Rahman, President of the\\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh, on\\nAugust 15, 1975, Khandaker Mushtaque\\nAhmed in total violation of the\\nConstitution, illegally seized the office of\\nPresident of Bangladesh, as such, he wge\\nan usurper.\\n<br>\\n(ii) He had no authority to function as the\\nPresident, as such, the Proclamation of\\nMartial Law on August 20, 1975, and his\\ntenure as the purported President for\\n82(eighty-two) days was illegal.', '<br>', '(iii) The assumption of office of a President of\\nBangladesh by the then Chief Justice of\\nBangladesh on November 6, 1975 and the\\nassumption of powers of the Chief Martial\\nLaw Administrator by the Second\\nProclamation issued on November 08,\\n1975 was in total disregard of the\\nConstitution.\\n<br>\\n(iv) Appointment of Major General Ziaur\\nRahman, as the Chief Martial\\nAdministrator by the Third Proclamation\\nissued on November 29, 1976, was made,\\nbeyond the ambit and in total disregard of\\nthe Constitution\\n<br>\\n(v) Appointment of Major General Ziaur\\nRahman as the President of Bangladesh\\non April 21, 1977, was made in violation\\nand in total disregard of the Constitution.\\n<br>\\n(vi) As such, all the Martial Law\\nProclamations, Martial Law Regulations\\nincluding the Martial Law Regulation No.\\nVII of 1977 and the Martial Law Orders,\\nwere made by the usurpers of the office of\\nPresident in violation and in total disre-\\ngard of the Constitution , as such, illegal,\\nvoid ab initio and nonest in the eye of law.', '            ', '158. AS it appears to decide the above issues,\\nat first the Court Division referred to the\\n proclamations dated 20 August 1975, 8 November\\n1975 and 29 November 1975 and also different\\nMartial Law Regulations and Orders.', '\\nThe first is the “Proclamation” dated 20th August 1975 which\\nproclaimed as follows:\\n<br>', '\"WHEREAS I, Khandaker Mushtaque\\nAhmed, with the helg and mercy of the\\nAlmighty Allah and relying upon the blessings\\nof the people, have taken over all and full pow-\\ners of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh with effect from the morning of\\nthe 15th August, 1975. <br> <br>', '', '', 'AND WHEREAS I placed, on the morning of\\nthe 15th August, 1975 the whole of Bangladesh\\nunder Martial Law by a declaration broadcast\\nfrom all stations of Radio Bangladesh;\\n<br>\\nAND WHEREAS, with effect from the mom-\\ning of the 15th August, 1975, I have suspended\\nthe provisions of article 48, in so far as it relates\\nof election of the President of Bangladesh, and\\nArticle 55 of the Constitution of the People’s\\nRepublic of Bangladesh, and modified the pro-\\nvisions of article 148 thereof and form I of the\\nThird Schedule thereto to the effect that the oath\\nof office of the President of Bangladesh shall be\\nadministered by the Chief Justice of Bangladesh\\nand that the president may enter upon office\\nbefore he takes the oath;\\n<br>\\nNow, thereof, I, Khandaker Mushtaque\\nAhmed, in exercise of all powers enabling me in\\nthis behalf, do hereby declare that—\\n<br>\\n(a) I have assumed and entered upon the\\nOffice of the President of Bangladesh with effect\\nom the morning of the 15th August, 1975;\\n<br>\\n(b) I may make, from time to time, Martial\\nW Regulations and Orders—\\n<br> <br>\\ni) providing for setting up Special\\nCourts or Tribunals for the trial and\\npunishment of any offence under', 'such Regulations or Orders or for\\ncontravention thereof, and of\\noffences under any other law;\\n<br>\\n(ii) prescribing penalties for offences\\nunder such Regulations or Orders\\nor for contravention thereof and\\nspecial penalties for offences under\\nany other law;\\n<br>\\n(iii) empowering any Court or Tribunal\\nto try and punish any offence under\\nsuch Regulation or Order or the\\ncontravention thereof’\\n<br>\\n(iv) barring the jurisdiction of any Court\\nor Tribunal from trying any offence\\nspecified in such Regulations or\\nOrders;\\n<br><br>\\n(c) I may rescind the declaration of Martial\\nLaw made on the moming of the 15th August,\\n1975, at any time, either in respect of the whole\\nof Bangladesh or any part thereof, and may again\\nplace the whole of Bangladesh or any part there-\\nof under Martial Law by a fresh declaration;\\n<br>\\n(d) this Proclamation and the Martial Law\\nRegulations and Orders made by me in pur-\\nsuance thereof shall have effect notwithstanding\\nanything contained in the Constitution of the\\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh or in any law\\nfor the time being in force;\\n<br>\\n(e) the Constitution of the People’s\\nRepublic of Bangladesh shall, subject to this\\nProclamation and the Martial Law Regulations\\nand Orders made by me in pursuance thereof,\\ncontinue to remain in force;\\n<br>\\n(f) all Acts, Ordinance, President’s Orders\\nand other Orders,', 'Proclamations rules, regulations, bye-laws,\\nnotifications and other legal instruments in\\nforce on the moming of the 15th August, 1975,\\nshall continue to remain in force until repealed,\\nrevoked or amended ;', '            \\n<br>', '(g) no Court, including the Supreme Court,\\nor tribunal or authority shall have any power to\\ncall in question in any manner whatsoever or\\ndeclare illegal or void this Proclamation or any\\nMartial Law Regulation or Order made by me in\\npursuance thereof, or any declaration made by\\nor under this Proclamation, or mentioned in this\\nProclamation to have been made, or anything', '\"done or any action taken by or under this', 'Proclamation, or mentioned in this', 'Proclamation to have been done or taken, or\\nanything done or any action taken by or under\\nany Martial Law Regulation or Order made by\\nme in pursuance of this Proclamation ;\\n<br>\\n(h) I may, by order notified in the official\\nGazette, amend this Proclamation.', '159.

As it appears by the above Order,\\namongst others, sub Article (1) of Article 102 was\\nrestored to its original position along with incidenta]\\namendments and the Supreme Court was again\\nmade to consist of the “Appellate Division™ and the\\n“High Court Division” with effect from December |\\nof 1977 and in Article 44 the words “High Court™\\nwas substituted by the words “High Court\\nDivision”. As stated earlier, by Second Proclamation\\n(seventh Amendment) Order, 1976, separate Courts\\nsuch a “Supreme Court” and “High Court” were set\\nup with effect from 13th August, 1976.', \"174. The next is the Second Proclamation\\n(Fifteenth Amendment) Order, 1978 (Second\\nProclamation Order No. IV of 1978) dated Sth\\nDecember, 1978.\\n<br>\\nThe Preamble of the above Order shows that the\\nobject of the above Order was only to replace the\\nremaining portion of the undemocratic provisions of\\nthe Constitution incorporated by the Fourth\\nAmendment. But this is not correct. It may be noted\\nthat earlier by Proclamation Order No.l of 1977\\nchanges were made only in the English Text of some\\namendments of the Constitution and the Bengali\\nText of those amendments remained as it is. By this\\nOrder similar changes were made in the Bengali\\nText. Further, changes were also made by inserting\\nSub Article (1A), (1B) and (1C) in Article 142 of' the\\nConstitution providing that for amendment of the\\npreamble or any provisions of Articles 8, 48, 56, 58,\\n80, 92A or this sub Article (1A), referendum to be\\nheld. Further Articles 92A and 145A were also\\ninserted giving the President wider powers.\", '175. Regarding the submission of the petition-\\ners that because of the Fourth Amendment, Fifth\\nAmendment had to be made has also no substance.\\nAssuming that Fourth Amendment was violative of\\nthe basic features of the Constitution, there was no\\nchallenge of the Fourth Amendment in the Supreme', '            \\nCourt as were done in the case of the Eighth\\nAmendment as well as in the present casc,', '176. The High Court Division held that though\\nin the Preamble of the above Order the object as\\nshown was to replace the remaining portion of the\\nundemocratic  provisions incorporated in the\\nConstitution by the Fourth Amendment, but many of\\nthe provisions incorporated by the Fourth\\nAmendment have already been dismantled by\\nMartial Law Regulations. Moreover, by the above\\nOrder not only the office of the President with all the\\npoWers provided by the Fourth Amendment were\\nkept very much intact but by inserting Article 92A,\\nundemocratic provisions, the Parliament was made\\nsubservient to the President for all practical purpos-\\nes with the view that in an unlikely event, even if the\\nParliament fails to make grants or to pass the budg-\\net under Articles 89 and 90, or refuses or reduces the\\ndemands for grants, under the above Article 92A the\\nPresident, without any worries about the funds,\\ncould dissolve the Parliament at his pleasure. In this\\nway the then President of Bangladesh by the above\\nOrder of 1978 became the most powerful Chief\\nExecutive virtually without any checks and balance\\neither from the Parliament or from any body else.\\nHowever, the above Article 92A was omitted by the\\nTwelfth Amendment by which though the\\nParliamentary system of Government was restored,\\nbut the supervisory power of the Supreme Court\\nover the subordinate judiciary, as was given in\\nAtticle 116 of the original Constitution, was nol\\nrestored and it remained with the Executive. Further\\nmany provisions of the Fourth Amendment have not\\nyet been disturbed, as if, those being pieces of dem-\\nocratic principle were required to be kept intact,', '177. Then while the Parliament was already in\\nsession and The Constitution (Fifth Amendment)\\nAct, 1979 which is under challenge, had already\\nbeen enacted and was publishcd in Bangladesh\\nGazette on April 6, 1979, by The Proclamation\\nDated April 6, 1979 which was published in the\\nBangladesh Gazette Extraordinary on 7th April,\\n1979. This was the last proclamation issued by the\\nChief Martial Law Administrator by which Martial\\nLaw was revoked with effect from 8-00 PM of\\nApril, 6, 1979.', '178. As it appears in the above Proclamation\\ndated April 6, 1979 the reasons for imposing Martial\\nLaw arc as follows :—\\n<br>\\n“ WHEREAS in the interest of peace, order,\\nsecurity, progress, prosperity and development\\nof the country the whole of Bangladesh was\\nplaced under Martial Law on 15 August, 1975.”\\n<br>\\nBut as it appears in the Preamble of the Procla-\\nmation dated 20th August, 1978 no indication of any\\ngrave situation was given. The Parliament was very', '“much in existence as on 15-8-75 and further in view', 'of the death of the then President, the then Vice\\nPresident was to take the charge of the President till\\na new President was elected. As such how the situa-\\ntion for declaring Martial Law as indicated above\\narose on August 15, 1975 ?\\n<br>\\nFurther in the above Order the reason for revok-\\ning the Martial Law was given as follows :—\\n<br>\\n“AND, WHEREAS the situation in the country\\nin all respect has since improved, and all other\\nauthorities and institution in the country may\\nnow properly function in accordance with the\\nConstitution and the law.”', 'But however clause (O) of the above proclama-\\ntion the following unusual power was given to the\\nPresident:—\\n<br>\\n“(0) the President may, for the purpose of\\nremoving any difliculty that may arise in giving\\neffect to any provision of this Proclamation\\nmake, by order, such provisions as he deems\\nnecessary or expedient and every such order\\nshall have effect notwithstanding anything con-\\ntained in the Constitution or in any other law for\\nthe time being in force.”', 'Considering the above clause (O), the High\\nCourt Division held that the above proclamation\\nsought to subordinate the Constitution as clause (O)\\nof the above Proclamation provided that the', '            ', \"President may make any order “notwithstanding\\nanything contained in the Constitution” though till\\nthe abo:'c Proclamation the President did not hi:l\\\\'C\\nany such power and thus this Proclamation\\nbestowed “Supra Constitutional’ power on the then\\nPresident of Bangladesh.\", '179. Regarding the legality of the Proclama-\\ntions dated August 20, 1975, November 8, 1975 and\\nNovember 29, 1973, the High Court Division stated', 'as follows :\\n<br>\\n“During ancient times proclamations were\\na source of law in England. King Henry the VIII\\n(1509-1547) used to assert his power to make\\nlaws by way of proclamations. By the Statute of\\n1539, the King could legislate by Proclamations\\nwithout Parliament. This Act was, however,\\nrepealed during the reign of Edward VI\\n(1547-1553).

But how and what chain of\\nevents led the Chief Justice of Bangladesh to\\nbecome not only the President of Bangladesh\\nbut also the Chief Martial Law Administrator\\n(CMLA), is far from clear. But in any case he\\nwas there as the President of Bangladesh and\\nthe CMLA as apparent from the Proclama-\\ntion dated November 8, 1975.', 'The office of CMLA is a relic from\\nthe past. In the erstwhile Pakistan, General\\nAyub Khan was appointed CMLA by the\\nProclamation dated October 7, 1958 and\\nagain General Yahya Khan declared himself\\nas the CMLA on March 25, 1969.', 'Earlier, although Martial Law was\\nclamped on the country since August 15,\\n1975 but apparently no Martial Law\\nAdministrator was appointed but this time\\nJustice Sayem by the Proclamation dated\\nNovember 8, 1975, made some modifica-\\ntions in the earlier proclamation and also\\nappointed the Chief of Army Staff, Major\\nGeneral Ziaur Rahman BU psc; the Chief of\\nNaval Staff, Commodore MH Khan, PSN.,\\nBN and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice\\nMartial MG Tawab SJ, S.Bt, PSA, BAF, as\\nDeputy Chief Martial Law Administrators.', 'Justice Sayem remained CMLA till\\nNovember 29, 1976 and resigned from the\\noffice of President on April 21, 1977. During\\nthis time, a huge number of MLRs and\\nMLOs were issued. Besides, various provi-\\nsions of the Constitution were amended from\\ntime to time by amendment of the Second\\nProclamation.', 'On our query as to how and under\\nwhat law Justice Sayem, the Chief Justice of', '            ', '\\nBangladesh, could take over as the President\\nof Bangladesh and also assumed the powers\\nof CMLA, the learned Additional Attomey-\\nGeneral was without any answer,\\n<br>\\nWe ourselves tried to probe but could\\nnot find any.

Next question is whether the situation as\\nitexisted on August 15, 1975 necessitated the impo-\\nsition of Martial Law.', '181. Inthis regard it may be noted that in erst-\\nwhile Pakistan, at first, Martial Law was imposed on\\nOctober 7, 1958 by Iskander Mirza, the then', '            ', 'president, and thereafler on March 26, 1969 Martial\\nLaw was imposed by General Yahya Khan and in\\nboth occasion some pretexts were raised for declar-\\ning Martial Laws. But while imposing Martial Law\\non August 15, 1975 and also while issuing the\\nproclamation dated August 20, 1975 Khandaker\\nMushtaque Ahmed did not raise any such pretext.\\nWhile discussing the Proclamation dated April 6,\\n1979 we have already stated that on August 15, 1975\\nthe Parliament was very much in existence and\\nVice-President was also available. Accordingly in\\nview of the killing of the then President, the consti-\\ntutional machinery should have automatically come\\ninto effect and the Vice President should have taken\\nover as Acting President until fresh election was\\nheld for the choice of a successor. The political\\nmachinery would then have moved according to the\\nConstitution and the Parliament could have taken\\nsteps to resolve the crisis if Khandaker Mushtaque\\nAhmed had not, by Proclamation dated August 20,\\n1975, suspended the provision of Article 48 of the\\nConstitution so far it related to the election of the\\nPresident and likewise Justice ASM Sayem, to\\nwhom Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed allegedly\\nhanded over the power of the President, had not dis-\\nsolved the Parliament by Proclamation dated\\nNovember 8, 1975. Accordingly Khandaker\\nMushtaque Ahmed, Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad\\nSayem and subsequently Major General Ziaur\\nRahman, to whom Justice Abusadat Mohammad\\nSayem handed over the Office of the President/\\nChief Martial Law Administrators in unconstitution-\\nal way, also did not allow the constitutional machin-\\nery to come into effect and on usurping the power of\\nthe Government started issuing all kinds of\\nProclamations, Martial Law Regulations and\\nOrders.', \"182. Regarding this the High Court Division\\nobserved as follows:\\n<br>\\nIf we look back to the history we would\\nfind that the Civil War of 1861 in the United\\nStates threatened its very existence as onc\\nnation. It engulfed the entire country. War we'nl\\non in almost everywhere in the country with\\nbleak prospect for survival of the States as unit-\\ned with their Constitution. Nobody could blame\\nthe President of the United States or others in\\nthat precarious and catastrophic situation if the\\nConstitution of the country was pushed to the\\nback-seat due to the said extreme emergency\\nbut even in that critical situation the citizens of\\nthe North upheld the high ideals of democratic\\nprinciples and did not at all compromise and\\ngive in to the inhuman demands of the Souther-\\nners, for allowing slavery in the country in vio-\\nlation of the principles of liberty and equality, as\\nenshrined in the Constitution, rather, they held\\nthe Constitution high above everything and\\nfought with their lives to free the slaves in vin-\\ndication of the rights guaranteed under the\\nConstitution.\\n<br>\\nAlthough there was serious controversy all\\nover the country on the issue of slavery but even\\nin such a trying moment, no proclamation\\ndeclaring Martial Law was made. Instead. their\\nlawfully elected President gave this message to\\nthe Congress on July 4, 1861, on the outbreak of\\nthe Civil War:\\n<br>\\n“It presents to the whole family of\\nman the question whether a constitutional\\nrepublic or democracy-a government of the\\npeople by the same peoplecan or cannot\\nmaintain its territorial integrity against its\\nown domestic foes. It presents the question\\nwhether discontented individuals, too few in\\nnumbers to control administration according\\nto organic law in any case, can always, upon\\nthe pretences made in this case or any other\\npretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence,\\nbreak up their government and thus practically\\nput an end to free government upon the earth,\\nIt forces us to ask: ‘Is there, in all republics,\\nthis inherent and fatal weakness ? Must a gov-\\nernment, of necessity, be too strong for the lib-\\nerties of its own people, or too weak to main-\\ntain its own existence?” (Quoted from KC\\nWheare: Modern Constitutions, Second\\nEdition, 1966, page-142).\", '\\n            ', '183. Even the Supreme Court did not relent in\\nthat horrendous situation when the battles were\\nfought everywhere but upheld the Constitution. In\\nthe case of Ex Parte Milligan (1866), Justice Davis,\\nin delivering its opinion of the Court held:—\\n<br>\\n“This nation, as experience has proved,', 'cannot always remain at peace, and has no right\\nto expect that it will always have wise and\\nhumane rulers, sincerely attached to the princi-\\nples of the Constitution. wicked men, ambitious\\nof power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of\\nlaw, may fill the place once occupied by\\nWashington and Lincoln; and if this right is con-\\nceded, and the calamities of war again befall us,\\nthe dangers to human liberty are frightful to\\ncontemplate. If our fathers had failed to provide\\nfor just such a contingency, they would have\\nbeen false to the trust reposed in them. They\\nknewothe history of the world told theméthe\\nnation they were founding, be its existence short\\nor long, would be involved in war; how often or\\nhow long continued, human foresight could not\\ntell; and that unlimited power, wherever lodged\\nat such a time, was especially hazardous to\\nfreemen. For this, and other equally weighty\\nreasons, they secured the inheritance they had,\\nfought to maintain, and by incorporating in a\\nwritten constitution the safeguards which time\\nhad proved were essential to its preservation.\\nNot one of these safeguards can the President,\\nor Congress, or the Judiciary disturb, except the\\none concerning the writ of habeas corpus.\\n<br>\\n....................................................\\n<br>\\n...... Knowing this, they limited the suspension to\\none great right, and left the rest to remain for-\\never inviolable. But, it is insisted that the safety\\nof the country in time of war demands that this\\nbroad claim for martial law shall be sustained. If\\nthis were true, it could be well said that a coun-\\ntry, preserved at the sacrifice of all the cardinal\\nprinciples of liberty, is not worth the cost of\\npreservation. Happily, it is not so0.”............\\n(Quoted from Professor John P Frank on ; Cases\\nAnd Materials on Constitutional Law (1952\\nRevision) at page 263-64) .', '184. Regarding the other point as to whether\\nFifth Amendment negates the Constitution and\\nrepugnant to the basic feature of the Constitution, it\\nwas argued before the High Court Division that the\\nprovisions for amendment of the Constitution is pro-\\nvided for in Article 142 and amendment can be done\\nonly in the manner provided therein and since the\\nFifth Amendment validating all illegal acts of the\\nusurpers under the cover of Martial Law, not only\\nchanged the basic structure as well as the character\\nof the Constitution in its totality but rather uprooted\\nthe Constitution and as such, in the eye of law, it was\\nno amendment but destruction of the Constitution\\naltogether. As such Fifth Amendment is wlira vires', 'the Constitution.\\nThe High Court Division held as follows:\\n<br>\\n“Major General Ziaur Rahman, BU being\\nappointed as the Chief of Army Staff on the\\nAugust 22, 1975, by Khandaker Mushtaque\\nAhmed, was still in the active service in the\\nRepublic of Bangladesh, when he entered the\\noffice of the President. It should be noted that\\nby virtue of his office as President, the Supreme\\nCommand of the defence services, of Bangla-\\ndesh was vested in him but at the same time he\\nwas a servant of the Republic as the Chief of\\nArmy Staff”.\\n<br>\\nIt should also be noted that in pursuance to\\nthe Order dated April 21, 1977, Major General\\nZiaur Rahman, BU must have taken the follow-\\ning oath before entering the office of President:\\n<br>\\nThe English text is :<br>', '“1 .The President.-An oath (or affirmation)\\nin the following form shall be administered by\\nthe Chief Justice.

The High Court Division regarding the\\nchanges made by the above Proclamations dated\\nAugust 20, 1975, November 8, 1975, and November\\n25,1976 concluded as follows:—\\n<br>\\n“(i) These changes were made by a nominat-\\ned President and CMLA-who had no leg-\\nislative power either to make a law or\\nabrogate any, not to speak of any of the\\nprovision of the Constitution but it was\\ndone.\\n<br>', '\\n(ii)  Votes of not less than two-thirds of the\\ntotal number of members of Parliament is\\nrequired to amend a provision of the\\nConstitution. No Parliament was in exis-\\ntence, on the said date on April 23, 1977,\\nbut without following the above noted\\nprocedure, as stipulated in Article 142,\\nthe changes in various provisions of the\\nConstitution were made by the above\\nnoted Proclamation Order.\\n<br>\\n(iii) The above noted insertion and substitu-\\ntion of provisions, among others, made in\\nthe Constitution, changed its basic char-\\nacter, as such, could not even be done by\\nthe two-thirds of the total number of\\nmembers of the Parliament.\\n<br>\\n(iv) The Constitution was made subservient\\nto the Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs.\\n<br>\\nThis is no amendment of the Constitution\\neven in the plain eyes, but destruction of the\\nbasic character of the Constitution by a\\nProclamation Order issued by the CMLA. But\\nthe Second Parliament ratified and validated the\\nsaid Proclamation. Order No.1 of 1977 by the\\nFifth Amendment. Not only the Proclamations\\nbut also Martial Law Regulations and Martial\\nLaw Order made under the various Proclama-\\ntions, were also ratified and validated.\\n<br>\\nUnder the above noted Proclamations, a\\ncouple of hundred MLRs and MLOs were made\\nfrom time to time to suit the needs of the\\nusurpers, since the promulgation of the Martial\\nLaw on August 20, 1975, till it was withdrawn\\non April 7, 1979. All those MLRs and MLOs\\nwere also ratified and validated by the Fifth\\nAmendment, passed on April 6, 1979™.', '186. We have already discussed as to how our\\nConstitution is supreme and under the Constitution\\nall the powers and functions of the Republic are\\nvested in the three organs of the Government, name-\\nly, Legislature, Executive and Judiciary and since all\\nthese organs owe their existence to the Constitution,', '            ', 'which is the embodiment of the will of the people as\\nheld by the superior Courts, the basic features of the\\nConstitution cannot be changed by Proclamations,\\nMartial Law Regulations or Orders.', '187. From the analysis of Proclamations,\\nMLRs and MLOs and the findings of our Apex\\nCourt as stated above, it is crystal clear that the\\nConstitution was made subordinate and subservient\\nto the Proclamations dated August 20, 1975,\\nNovember 8, 1975 and November 29, 1976 and the\\nMartial Law Regulations and Martial Law Orders\\nmade there under and as such those are w/tra vires\\nthe Constitution. There is no provision in the\\nConstitution, which is ‘Supra Constitutional’, or to\\nput it mildly, ‘Extra Constitutional’. All laws or pro-\\nvisions and actions taken thereon must, without any\\nexception, conform to the.Constitution. Any law or\\nprovision, which is beyond the ambit of the\\nConstitution, is w/tra vires and void and as such non-\\nest in the eye of law. The doubtless supremacy of the\\nConstitution is far above all institutions, functionar-\\nies and services it created.', '188. The High Court Division also narrated\\nthe submission of the learned Counsel of the profor-\\nma respondent No.5 which is as follows:\\n<br>\\n“Mr Akhtar Imam, Advocate, however, in\\nsupport of Martial Law, contended that in our\\ncountry a Martial Law culture or Martial Law', 'jurisprudence has been evolved. He based his\\nargument partly on the book ‘Bangladesh\\nConstitution: Trends And Issues’ by Justice\\nMustafa Kamal. The learned Advocate, read\\nextensively from the said book and argued that\\nwhether we like it or not we can neither avoid nor\\noverlook the long shadows of Marshals. They are\\nthere and it is better to acknowledge them.”', '189. The High Court Division answered the\\nabove submission as follows:\\n<br>\\n“We have given our utmost consideration\\nto the above submission of Mr Akhtar Imam but\\nfound no substance. Rather we must acknowl-\\nedge that we no longer live in the era of Henry\\nVIII, Lois XIV or even Napoleon Bonaparte,\\nwhose words were law.

The Constitution guar-\\nantees it, 5o also the Court and every body must\\nfollow this principle without any exception, in\\nthis Twenty First Century”.', '190. The High Court Division after consider-\\ning all the aspects concluded as follows:—\\n<br>\\n“There is no existence of Martial Law\\nAuthorities or Martial Law Proclamations,\\nRegulations or Order in our Constitution or any\\nof the laws of the land. Those authorities or\\nproclamations are quite foreign to our jurispru-\\ndence. Still those proclamations etc were\\nimposed on the people of Bangladesh. Those\\nhave got no legal basis.

It is ordained\\nthat we must not and appreciate the facts and the\\nlaw in its proper perspective.\\n<br>\\nWe have done so. We must hold and declare\\nthat this Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act,\\n1979, is not law”.', '191. Further as we have already stated while\\ndealing with the principle of the supremacy of the\\nConstitution, the will of the people does not con-\\ntemplate Martial Law or any other laws not made in\\naccordance with the Constitution. The armed forces\\nare also subject to the will of the people and their\\noaths as provided in section 15(2) of the Army Act\\n1952, section 17(2) of the Air Force Act 1953 and\\nsection 14 of the Navy Ordinance 1961, make it\\nplain. They serve the “people” and can never', 'become the masters of the “people’”, Accordingly:', 'Martial Law is unconstitutional and illigal and it is\\na mischievous device not founded in any law known\\nin Bangladesh and by Martial law the whole nation\\nWhole nation\\nis hijacked by some people with the support of the\\narmed forces and the whole nation goes into a state\\nof siege; it is like that the whole nation and “we, the\\npeople of Bangladesh”, are taken hostage and fur-\\nther like a hostage-taking situation, the hostage ti-\\ners themselves recognize that there is 2 superior law\\nthan their weapons which “Ve, the people” put in\\ntheir hands to serve us and they recognize that there\\nare two impediments to their taking over power of\\nassuming power, first, the Constitution itself and so they, at first, start by saying “Notwithstanding any-\\nthing in the Constitution” because they recognize\\nthat the Constitution is superior but they choose 10\\nbrush it aside, The second impediment to Martial\\nLaw is the Superior Court of the Republic entrusted\\nwith the solemn duty to “preserve, protect and\\ndefend the Constitution” and so every Martial Law,\\nimmediately upon Proclamation seeks to curb the\\npowers of the Court, particularly, the powers of the\\nConstitutional Court.', '192. According to the spirit of the Preamble\\nand also Article 7 of the Constitution the military\\nrule, direct or indirect, is to be shunned once for all.\\nLet it be made clear that military rule was wrongly\\njustified in the past and it ought not to be justified in\\nfuture on any ground, principle, doctrine or theory\\nwhatsoever, Military rule is against the dignity, hon-\\nour and glory of the nation that it achieved after\\ngreat sacrifice; it is against the dignity and honor of\\nthe people of Bangladesh who are committed 10\\nuphold the sovereignty and integrity of the nation by\\nall means; it is also against the honour of each and\\nevery soldier of the Armed Forces who are oath\\nbound to bear true faith and allegiance to Bangla-\\ndesh and uphold the constitution, which embodies\\nthe will of the people, honestly and faithfully serve\\nBangladesh in their respective services and also see\\nthat the Constitution is upheld, it is not kept in sus-\\npension or abrogated, it is not subverted, it is not\\nmutilated, and to say. the: least it is not held in', '            ', 'abeyance and it is not amended by an authority not\\ncompetent to do so under the Constitution.', '193. It may be mentioned here that the power\\nto amend the Constitution is an ONErous task\\nassigned to the Parliament, which represents the will', 'of the people through their chosen representatives. It\\nis to be carried out in accordance with the procedure', 'prescribed in Article 142 of the Constitution and by\\nno other means, in no other manncr and by no one\\nelse.

Indeed, the Constitution is an', 'organic whole and a living document meant for all', 'times to come.', '194. In the cases of AT Mridha and Anwar\\nHossain this Division held that there is no existence\\nof Martial Law or the Martial Law Proclamations,\\nRegulations or Orders in our Constitution or any of\\nthe laws of the land. Those authorities or the\\nProclamation etc. are quite foreign to our jurispru-\\ndence. Still those Proclamations etc. were imposed\\non the people of Bangladesh. Those have got no\\nJegal basis. Those are illegal and imposed by force.\\nThe people are constrained to accept it for the time\\nbeing, not out of attraction or its legality but out of', 'fear.', '195. Further, the Parliament though may\\namend the Constitution under Article 142 but cannot\\nmake the Constitution subservient to any other\\nProclamations etc, or cannot disgrace it in any man-\\nner since the Constitution is the embodiment and\\nsolemn expression of the will of the people of\\nBangladesh, attained through the supreme sacrifice\\nof nearly three million martyrs., Further the\\nParliament, by amendment of the Constitution can-\\nnot legitimize any illegitimate activity.', \"196'. Accordingly, keeping the Constitution in\\nsuspension and/or making amendments therein by\\nany authority not mentioned in the Constitution oth-\\nerwise than in accordance with the procedure pre-\\nscribed in the Constitution itself, is tantamount to\\nmutilating, and/or subverting the Constitution. The\\nParliament cannot ratify and validate those uncon-\\nstitutional acts of usurpers as the Parliament is not\", 'supreme over everything else like the Parliament of', 'the United Kingdom, rather it is independent of\\nother organs of the State, but it certainly operates\\nwithin certain parameters under the Constitution.', \"197. As it appears our country entered its\\n“period of delinquency” at its very early Part in\\n1975 and that delinquency continued for long 16\\nyears, Martial Law fall in the category of “black\\nJaw” and the treatment of Martial Law by the Court,\\nwas  mostly based on Dosso's case (supra).\\nAccordingly the ghost of Dosso’s case should be\\ngiven a go bye from our jurisprudence forever so\\nthat no one can ever again even think about overrid-\\ning “the will of the people” of Bangladesh and all\\nmust also ensure that this history never repeats and\\nall must recognize these faults of the past and must\\nrectify them so that our conscience remains clear.\", '198. The footprints that the “period of delin-\\nquency” leaves behind are Martial Law\\nProclamations, Regulations and Orders in the form\\nof black laws and the ultimate insult to “We, the\\npeople” is the attempt to ratify these black laws by\\nbringing those into the umbrella of the Constitution\\nitself. In the present case the High Court Division\\nrecognizing these footprints sought to erase those\\nonce for all and since all the parties before the High\\nCourt Division agreed that the Constitution is\\nsupreme, obvious the result is that Martial Law is\\nillegal and unconstitutional. So this Court.should\\nnot, indeed cannot, grant leave in these petitions\\nbecause to do so would be perceived by “the people\\nof Bangladesh” in the way that our highest judiciary\\nis still unable, long after the *“period of delinquen-\\ncy”, to properly and adequately deal with such\\ndelinquency and further, it would send wrong sig-\\nnals to those who wish to circumvent the “will of the\\npeople” in the Constitution and that each of our gen-\\nerations must also be taught, educated and informed\\nabout those dark days; the easiest way of doing this', '            \\nis to recognize our errors of the pz?st and reflect these\\nsentiments in the. judgments of this Court which will\\nensure preservation of the sovereignty of “We, the\\nPwp]e of Bangladesh™ forever as a true “pole star”,', '199. Accordingly we hold that since the\\nConstitution is the Supreme law of the land and the\\nMartial Law Proclamations, Regulations and Orders', 'romulgated/made by the usurpers, being illegal,\\nvoid and non-est in the eye of law, could not be rat-\\nified or confirmed by the Second Parliament by the\\nFifth Amendment, as it itself had no such power to\\nenact such laws as made by the above Proclama-\\ntions, Martial Law Regulation or orders.', '200. Moreover, the Fifth Amendment ratifying\\nand validating the Martial Law Proclamations,\\nRegulations and Orders not only violated the\\nsupremacy of the Constitution but also the rule of\\nlaw and by preventing judicial review of the legisla-\\ntive and administrative actions, also violated two\\nother more basic features of the Constitution, name-\\nly, independence of judiciary and its power of judi-\\ncial review.', '201. As such we hold that the Fifth Amend-\\nment is also illegal and void and the High Court\\nDivision rightly declared the same as repugnant,\\nillegal and witra vires the Constitution.', '202. Since we have declared that Martial Law\\nProclamations, Regulations and Orders etc., are ille-\\ngal, void and non east and the Fifth Amendment is\\nalso ultra vires the Constitution question will arise\\nas to whether to prevent chaos and confusion and to\\navoid anomaly and to preserve continuity, the\\nactions and the legislative measures taken during\\nMartial Law period needs to be condoned / cured by\\nthe principles of doctrine of necessity.', '203. As it appears that this doctrine of necessi-\\nty is applied to condone some of the actions of an\\nusurper, but not all. In Madzimbamutu vs Lardner\\nBurke (1968) 3 All ER 561, 579 Lord Pearce, in his\\ndissenting judgment, termed the doctrine of condo-\\nnation as doctrine of implicd mandate and\\nobserved:—', '<br>', \"“l' accept the existence of the principle that\\nact done by those actually in control withoy\\nlawful validity may be recognized as valid or\\nacted on by the courts, with certain limitations\\nnamely, (a) so far as they are directed to and rea:\\nsonably required for ordinary running of the\\nState; and (b) so far as they do not impair the\\nrights of citizens under the lawful (1961) Cons-\\ntitution; and (c) so far as they are not intended\\nto and do not in fact directly help the usurpation\\nand do not run contrary to the policy of the law-\\nful sovereign. This is tantamount to a test of\\npublic policy.”\", '204. But since there are limits to the applica-\\ntion of such doctrine of necessity, in occasions, the\\nParliament to come out of this position, resorted to\\nthe private law contrivance of ratification of unau-\\nthorized actions of agents by principals. But there is\\nan inherent limitation even in respect of such ratifi-\\ncation as life cannot be given to a prohibited trans-\\naction by ratification. Again by the device of ratifi-\\ncation the Parliament or any authority cannot\\nincrease its authority. It can ratify only those actions\\nof others, which it can lawfully do. Thus parliament\\ncannot, by resorting to the device of ratification, rat-\\nify and render valid an amendment, which, itself,\\ncannot do because the same will lead to the infringe-\\nment of the basic features of the Constitution.', '205. Regarding doctrine of necessity and con-\\ndonation in Asma Jilani’s case Hamoodur Rahman', 'CJ held as follows:\\n<br>\\n“I too am of the opinion that recourse has to\\nbe taken to the doctrine of necessary where the\\nignoring of it would result in disastrous conse-\\nquences to the body politic and upset the social\\norder itself but I respectfully beg to disagree\\nwith the view that this is a doctrine for validat-\\ning the illegal acts of usurpers. In my }}umble\\nopinion this doctrine can be involved in aid only\\nafter the Court has come to the conclusion that\\nthe acts of the usurpers were illegal and illegiti-\\nmate. It is only then the question arises as to\\nhow many of his acts legislative or otherwise', '            ', 'should be condoned or maintained notwith-\\nstanding their illegality in the wider public\\ninterest. 1 would call this a principle of condo-\\nnation and not legitimization. Applying this test\\nI would condone (1) all transactions which are\\npast and closed for no useful purposc can be\\nserved by reopening them (2) all acts and leg-\\nislative measures which are in accordance with\\nor could have been made under the abrogated\\nconstitution or the previous legal order (3) all\\nacts which tend to advance or promote the good\\nof the people (4) all acts required to be done for\\nthe ordinary orderly running of the State and all\\nsuch measures as would establish or lead to\\nestablishment of in our case the objectives men-\\ntioned in the Objectives Resolution of 1954. I\\nwould not however condone any act intended to\\nentrench the usurper more firmly in his power\\nor to directly help him to run the country con-\\ntrary to the legitimate objectives. 1 would not\\ncondone anything which seriously impairs the\\nrights of the citizens except in so far as they\\nmay be designed to advance the social welfare', 'and national solidarity”.', '206. However, the High Court Division found\\nthat item (2) as referred above, on conversion,\\nmeans that any act or legislative measure, which is\\nnot in accordance with or could not have been made\\nunder the Constitution, cannot be held valid by\\napplying the doctrine of necessity and that\\nHamoodur Rahman CJ was speaking at a time when\\nPakistan was far away from accepting the doctrine\\nof basic structure and therefore he could speak of\\ncondoning legislative actions which, at that time, the\\nNational Assembly had the competence to pass.\\nPakistan Supreme Court, towards the end of the\\ntwentieth century, leaned towards the doctrine of\\nbasic structure and the doctrine of basic structure\\nwas accepted as late in the year 2000 in the case of\\nZafar Ali Shah (Supra).', '207. The High Court Division then regarding\\nfhe doctrine of necessity-and condonation expressed\\nits view as follows:—\\n<br>', '..........................................................\\n<br>\\n....................................................\\n<br>\\n“But in order to avoid confusion, legal or\\notherwise and also to keep continuity of the\\nsovereignty and legal norm of the Republic, we\\nhave next to consider as to whether the legisla-\\ntive acts purported to be done by those illegal\\nand void Proclamations etc. during the period\\nfrom August 15, 1975 to April 9, 1979, can be\\ncondoned, by invoking the doctrine of “ State', 'necessity”\\n<br>\\nBut it does not mean that for the sake of conti-\\nnuity of the sovereignty of the State, the\\nConstitution has to be soiled with illegalities, rather,\\nthe perpetrators of such illegalities should be suit-\\nably punished and condemned so that in future no\\nadventurist, no usurper, would have the audacity to\\ndefy the people, their Constitution, their\\nGovernment, established by them with their con-\\nsent.', '208. If we hark back to history, we would see\\nthat after Restoration in 1660, Charles II became\\nKing of England with effect from January 1649, the\\nday when his father, Charles I was beheaded, in\\norder to keep the lawful continuity of the Realm but\\nnot the continuity of the illegal administration of the', 'Commonwealth.', '209. The moral is, no premium can be given to\\nany body for violation of the Constitution for any rea-\\nson and for any consideration. What is illegal and\\nwrong must always be condemned as illegal and\\nwrong till eternity. In the present context, the illegality\\nand gravest wrong was committed against the People\\nRepublic of Bangladesh and its people as a whole.', '210. This doctrine of State necessity is no\\nmagic wand. It does not make an illegal act a legal\\none. But the Court in exceptional circumstances, in\\norder to avert the resultant evil of illegal legisla-\\ntions, may condone such illegality on the greater\\ninterest of the community in general but on condi-\\ntion that those acts could have been legally done at\\nleast by the proper authority.', '            ', \"211.  This doctrine of State necessity was pos-\\nsibly applied for the first time in this sub-continent\\nin Pakistan in the Reference by His Excellency the\\nGovernor-General in Special Reference No.l of\\n1955 [PLD 1955 FC 435 = 7 DLR (FC) 395]. This\\nReference was made under section 213 of the\\nGovernment of India Act, 1935. It shows how\\nGhulam Muhammad, the Governor-General of\\npakistan was caught in his own palace clique but\\nwas rescued by an over-anxious Supreme Court by\\nreincarnating a long forgotten doctrine of State\\nnecessity. The Hon’ble Chief Justice looked for help\\nin the 13th century Brocton digged deep into the\\nearly Middle Ages for Kings prerogatives and the\\nmaxims, such as, Id Quod Alias Non Est Licitum,\\nNecessitas Licitum Facit (that which otherwise is\\nnot lawful, necessity makes lawful), salus populi\\nSuprema lex (safety of the people is the supreme\\nJaw) and salus republicae est suprema lex (safety of\\nthe State is the supreme law). His Lordship\\nreferred to Chitty’ s exposition and Maitland’s dis-\\ncussion on the Monarchy in England in late 17th\\ncentury. His Lordship thereafter referred to the\\nsumming up of Lord Mansfield, to the Jury in the\\nproceedings against George Stratton and then held\\nat pages 485-6:\\n<br>\\n“The principle clearly emerging from this\\naddress of Lord Mansfield is that subject to the\\ncondition of absoluteness, extremeness and\\nimminence, an act which would otherwise be\\nillegal becomes legal if it is bone bona fide\\nunder the stress of necessity, the necessity being\\nreferable to an intention to preserve the consti-\\ntution, the State or the Society and to prevent it\\nfrom dissolution, and affirms Chittyfs statement\\nthat necessity knows no law and the maxim\\ncited by Bracton that necessity makes lawful\\nwhich otherwise is not lawful....... the indis-\\npensable condition being that the exercise of\\nthat power is always subject to the legislative\\nauthority of parliament, to be exercised ex post\\nfacto....... The emergency legislative power,\\nhowever, cannot extend to matters which are not\\nthe product of the necessity, as for instance,\\nchanges in the constitution which are not dircct-\\nly referable to the emergency.”\\n<br>\\nBut what the Hon'ble Chief Justice decided to\\nignore was that the Governor-General himself\\nbrought disaster upon the entire country by dissolv-\\ning the Constituent Assembly ecarlier in October\\n1954 when the Prime Minister had already set the\\ndate for adopting the Constitution for Pakistan in\\nDecember, 1954. That itself was a violation of the\\nIndependence Act, 1947 and a treasonous act against\\nthe people of Pakistan. With great respect, the\\nGovernor-General ought not to have allowed to take\\nadvantage of his own grievous wrong against\\nPakistan. As a matter of fact, that was the beginning\\nof the end. Besides, the Hon’ble Chief Justice also\\nforgot that only a few months back in the case of\\nFederation of Pakistan vs Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan\\nPLD 1955 FC 240 =7 DLR (FC) 291, his Lordship\\nrefused to interfere even in case of a real disaster\\nbrought about, again by the Governor-General in\\ndissolving the Constituent Assembly.\", \"212. In that case the above Chief Justic;: held\\nat page. 299:\\n<br>\\n~ “It has been suggested by the leaned\\nJudges of the Sind Chief Court and has also\\nbeen vehemently urged before us that if the\\nview that I take on the question of assent be cor-\\nrect, the result would be disastrous because the\\nentire legislation passed by the Constituent\\nAssembly, and the acts done and orders passed\\nunder it will in that case have to be held to be\\nvoid, R [ am quite clear in my mind that\\nwe are not concerned with the consequences,\\nhowever beneficial or disastrous they may be, if\\nthe undoubted legal position was that all legis-\\nlation by the Legislature of the Dominion under\\nsection (3) of section 3 needed the assent of the\\nGovernor-General. If the result is disaster, it\\nwill merely be another instance of how thought-\\nlessly the Constituent Assembly proceeded with\\nits business and by assuming for itself the posi-\\ntion of an irremovable Legislature fo' what\\nstraits it has brought the country. Unless any\", '            ', 'rule of estoppel require us to pronounce merely\\npurported legislation as complete and valid leg-\\nislation, we have no option but to pronounce it\\nto be void and to leave it to the relevant author-\\nities under the Constitution or to the country {0\\nset right the position in any way it may be open\\nto them. The question raised involves the rights\\nof every citizen in Pakistan, and neither any rule\\nof construction nor any rule estoppel stands in\\nthe way of a clear pronouncement.”\\n<br>\\nThis stoic and stout stand like that of a 16th\\nCentury Common Law Judge was taken by Munir,\\nCJ, when the dissolution of the Constituent\\nAssembly was challenged but the same Chief\\nJustice became full of equity when the Governor-\\nGeneral was caught in his own game because of his\\nearlier dissolution of the Constituent Assembly.', '213. It appears that the Hon’ble Chief Justice\\nwas more concerned and worried about the difficul-\\nties of the Governor-General who was supposed to\\nbe only a titular head, than the Constituent\\nAssembly, the institution which represented the peo-\\nple of Pakistan but was dissolved by the Governor-\\nGeneral which augmented the constitutional crisis.\\nWith great respect, it appears that the Hon’ble Chief\\nJustice of Pakistan held a double standard in pro-\\ntecting the interest of the Govemor-General than\\nthat of the Constituent Assembly. He refused to', 'invoke the doctrine of necessity but upheld the dis-\\nsolution of the Constituent Assembly which by then\\nwas ready with the Constitution for Pakistan but\\ninvoked the said very doctrine in aid of the\\nGovemnor-General to steer him clear out of the con-\\nstitutional crisis, created by himself, by twisting and\\nbending the legal provisions even calling upon the', 'seven hundred years old maxims.', '214. However, Comelius, J in Tamizuddin\\nKhan\\'s case dissented and at page— 358 held as fol-\\nlows:\\n<br>\\n“J place the Constituent Assembly above the\\nGovernor-General, the chief Executive of the\\nState, for two reasons, firstly that the Constituent\\nAssembly was a sovereign body, and secondly\\nbecause the statutes under and in accordance\\nwith which the Governor-General was required\\nto function, were within the competence of the\\nConstituent Assembly to amend....\"”', '215. It should be noted that earlier to the\\nGovernor-Generals Reference No.l, in the case of\\nUsif Patel vs Crown PLD 1955 FC 387, decided on\\nApril 12, 1955, on behalf of an unanimous Supreme', \"Court, Munir CJ held at page -392:\\n<br>\\n“The rule hardly requires any explanation,\\nmuch less emphasis, that a Legislature cannot\\nvalidate an invalid law if it does not possess the\\npower to legislate on the subject to which the\\ninvalid law relates, the principle governing val-\\nidation being that validation being itself legisla-\\ntion you cannot validate what you cannot legis-\\nlate upon. Therefore if the Federal Legislature,\\nin the absence of a provision expressly author-\\nizing it to do so, was incompetent to amend the\\nIndian Independence Act or the Government of\\nIndia Act, the Governor-General possessing no\\nlarger powers than those of the Federal Legis-\\nlature was equally incompetent to amend either\\nof those Acts by an Ordinance. Under the\\nIndependence Act the authority competent {0\\nlegislate on constitutional matters being the\\nConstituent Assembly, it is that Assembly alone\\nwhich can amend those Acts. The learned\\nAdvocate-General alleges that the Constituent\\nAssembly has been dissolved and that therefore\\nvalidating powers cannot be exercised by that\\nAssembly. In Mr Tamizuddin Khan's case, we¢\\ndid not consider it necessary to decide the ques-\\ntion whether the Constituent Assembly was\\nlawfully dissolved but assuming that it was, the\\neffect of the dissolution can certainly not be the\\ntransfer of its powers to the Governor-General.\\nThe Governor-General can give or withhold his\\nassent to the legislation of the Constituent\\nAssembly but he himself is not the Constituent\\nAssembly and on its disappearance he can nei-\\nther claim powers, which he never possessed.\\nnor claim to succeed to the powers of that\", 'Assembly.”', '            ', \"216. His Lordship further held at page-396:\\n<br>\\n“This Court held in Mr Tamizuddin Khan's\\ncase that the Constituent Assembly was not a\\nsovereign body.

But in this connection, the opinion of De\\nSmith is pertinent:\\n<br>\\n“It is clear ... that the leading Pakistan\\ndecision in 1955 was a not very well disguised\\nact of political judgment. By the normal canons\\nof construction, what the Governor-General had\\ndone was null and void.

This is how the doctrine of necessity\\nmade its appearance in order to salvage what was\\nleft of the normal constitutional process in Pakistan\\nat that time in 1955.\\n<br>\\nThe High Court Division further held as fol-\\nlows:\\n<br>\\nIn the case of Asma Jilani vs Government of\\nPunjab PLD 1972 SC 139, Hamoodur Rahman, CJ,\\nheld at page-204-5:\\n<br>\\n“Reverting now to question of the legality\\nof the Presidential Order No.3 of 1969 and the\\nMartial Law Regulation No.78 of 1971 it fol-\\nlows from the reasons given carlier that they\\nwere both made by an incompetent authority\\nand, therefore; lacked the attribute of legitimacy\\nwhich is one of the essential characteristics of a\\nvalid law. The Presidential Order No.3 of 1969\\nwas also invalid on two additional grounds,\\nnamely, that it was a Presidential Order, which\\ncould not in terms of the Provisional Constitu-\\ntion Order itself amend the Constitution so as to\\ntake away the jurisdiction conferred upon the\\nHigh Courts under Article 98 and that it certain-\\nly could not, in any event, take away the judicial\\npower of the Courts to hear and determine ques-\\ntions pertaining even to their own jurisdiction\\nand this power could not be vested in another\\nauthority as long as the Courts continued to\\nexist.\\n<br>\\nThis does not, however, dispose of the\\ncase, for, we are again presented by the\\nlearned Attorney-General with the argument\\nthat a greater chaos might result by the\\nacceptance of this principle of legitimacy. He\\nhas reminded the Court of the grave conse-\\nquences that followed when in Maulvi\\nTamizuddin Khan's case a similar argument\\nwas spurned by the Federal Court and disas-\\nter brought in. I am not unmindful of the\\ngrave responsibility that rests upon Courts\\nnot to do anything which might make confu-\\nsion worse confounded or create a grealer\\nstate of chaos if that can possibly be avoided\\nconsistently with their duty to decide in\\naccordance with law. ......... This is a diffi-\\ncult question to decide and although I have\\nfor my guidance the example of our own\\nFederal Court, which in Governor-General s\\nReference No.1 of 1955 invoked the maxim\\nof salus populi suprema lex to create some\\nkind of an order out of chaos.

Then regarding the case of Nusrat Bhutto,\\non which the petitioners relied in which Pakistan\\nSupreme Court did not follow Asma Jilanis case\\nand gave approve to the imposition of Martial Law\\ninvoking doctrine of necessity, the High Court\\nDivision held as follows:', '            \\n“It appears, that the Supreme Court of\\nPakistan accepted the explanation piven by\\nGeneral Mohammad Ziaul Haq for the Army’s\\nintervention and validated such intervention and\\nthe imposition of Martial Law invoking the doc-\\ntrine of State necessity.

In this respect they were satisfied', 'with the explanations given by the Army Chief', 'of Staff. This was a U-turn of the Supreme\\nCourt from its carlier stand in the cascs of Asma', 'Jilani and Ziaur Rahman.”', '220. The High Court Division further held as', 'follows:—\\n<br>\\n......... As Judges, our only tools are the\\nConstitution, the laws made or adopted under it\\nand the facts presented before us. We are bound\\nby these instruments and we are to follow it.\\nThe plea of State necessity shall have to be con-\\nsidered within the bounds of these instruments\\nand not without those. That is how we read\\nGrotius and Lord Pearce in Madzimbamuto. But\\nGrotius or Lord Mansfield in Stration’s case\\n(1779) or Lord Pearce, did not dream of break-\\ning any law or giving legitimacy to an illegality,\\nfar less making the Constitution, the supreme\\nlaw of any country, subservient to the com-\\nmands of any Army General, whose only source\\nof power is through the muzzle of a gun\\nalthough all the Generals in any country seize\\npower in the name of the people and on the plea\\nof lack of democracy in the country with a\\nsolemn promise to restore it in no time, as if the', '-democracy can be handed down to the people in\\na well packed multi-coloured gift box.\\n<br>\\nDemocracy is a way of life.

The world history is replete with stories\\nof people, ordinary people who fought for their\\nrights in different names in different countries,', 'but the cry for liberty, the cry for equality, the\\ncry for fraternity were reverberated in the same\\nmanner from horizon to horizon. This sense of\\nliberty made us independent from the yoke of\\nthe British rule in 1947 and the same sense of\\nliberty pushed us through the war of liberation\\nin 1971 and brought Bangladesh into existence.\\nBut the proclamation of Martial Law is alto-\\ngether the negation of the said spirit of liberty\\nand independence. In this connection we would\\nrecall what was said in the case of Shamima\\nSultana Seema vs Government of Bangladesh\\n2LG (2005) 194 at para-123:\\n<br>\\n_ “It should be remembered that the\\ningrained spirit of the Constitution is its\\nintrinsic power.

The United\\nKingdom, although does not have any written\\nConstitution but has got the spirit of the\\nConstitution and that is why the people of that\\ncountry can feel proud of their democracy but\\nthere are countries with Constitutions, written\\nand amended many a times but without the\\nsaid spirit, the democracy remains a mirage™.', '221. The High Court Division further held as', 'follows:\\n<br>\\nWe have already discussed earlier that the\\nEnglish text of various portion of the Preamble,\\nArticle 6, Article 8, Article 9, Article 10 and\\nArticle 25 were altogether changed or replaced\\nwhile Article 12 was completely omitted by the\\nProclamations (Amendment) Order, 1977\\n(Proclamation Order No. 1 of 1977).

Since the said change was made\\nby a Martial Law Proclamation, it was without\\njurisdiction and non-est in the eye of law, as\\nsuch, there was nothing to ratify confirm or val-\\nidate by the subsequent Act of Parliament.........\\n<br>\\n............................................................................\\n<br>\\n..................................................................\\n<br>\\n            ', 'Under the circumstances, we deny\\ncondonation of both Bengali and English\\ntexts of the following provisions made in the\\nConstitution by the various Proclamations :\\n<br>\\n(1) The Amendments made in the Preamble\\nof the Constitution\\n<br>\\n(2) Article6<br>\\n(3) Artcle 8<br>\\n(4) Article 9<br>\\n(5) Article 10<br>\\n(6) Article 12<br>', '(7) Artcle 25\\n<br>\\n(8) Proviso to Article 38\\n<br>\\n(9) Clauses 1A, 1B and 1C to Article 142\\n<br>\\n(10) Paragraph 3A to the Fourth Schedule to\\nthe Constitution.', '222. For retaining Article 95 the High Court\\nDivision stated as follows:\\n<br>\\nIt may be reiterated that by the Second\\nProclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order,\\n1976 (Second Proclamation Order No. IV of\\n1976), several changes were made with effect\\nfrom 13-8-1977 in the Constitution as it stood\\nafter the Fourth Amendment. One of such\\nchanges was in respect of Article 95 of the\\nConstitution. This provision is in respect of\\nappointment of Judges in the Supreme Court.\\nArticle 95 in the original Constitution reads as', 'follows :\\n<br>\\n95 . (1) The Chief Justice shall be\\nappointed by the President, and the other\\nJjudges shall be appointed by the President\\nafter consultation with the Chief Justice,', '223. The Constitution (Fourth Amendment)\\nAct, 1975, changed clause (1) of Article 95 in the\\nfollowing manner :\\n<br>\\n95 .(1) The Chief Justice and other Judges\\nshall be appointed by the President..........\\n<br>\\nArticle 95(1) was again amended by the\\nSecond Proclamation (Seventh Amendment)\\nOrder, 1976 (Second Proclamation Order No.\\nIV of 1976) with effect from August 13, 1976,\\nin the following manner:', '95 . Appointment of Supreme Court\\nJudges,—(1) The Chief Justice of the\\nSupreme Court shall be appointed by the\\nPresident, and the other Judges shall be\\nappointed by the President after consultation', 'with the Chief Justice........\\n<br>\\nThis version commensurate with the Article 95', 'in the original unamended Constitution.\\n<br>\\nBut by the Second Proclamation (Tenth\\nAmendment) Order, 1977 (Second Proclama-\\ntion Order No. 1 of 1977) again changed Article\\n95(1) of the Constitution in the following man-ner:\\n<br>\\n95 . Appointment of Judges— (i) The Chief\\nJustice and other Judges shall be appointed by', 'the President........\\n<br>\\nThis form of Article 95(1) is exactly the\\nsame as made in the Fourth Amendment.', \"This Order containing Article 95 in this\\nform came into force on 1-12-1977 and remains\\nso in the Constitution till date in view of the\\nFifth Amendment, without further change™.\\n<br>\\nThis Second 'Proclamation (Tenth\\nAmendment) Order 1977 (Second Proclamation\\nOrder No. 1 of 1977) containing the latest ver-\\nsion of Article 95 was sought to be protected\\namongst others firstly by the Proclamations\\n(Amendment) Order, 1977 (Proclamations\\nOrder No. 1 of 1977), by inserting Paragraph\\n3A in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution.\\nThis was published in the Bangladesh Gazette\\nExtraordinary on 23-4-1977. Secondly, by\\ninsertion of Paragraph 18 in the Fourth\\nSchedule by the Constitution (Fifth Amend-\", 'ment) Act, 1979.', '            ', 'Since we have decided that we would\\napprove and condone the amendments made in\\nthe Constitution which would repeal the various\\nprovisions of the Constitution (Fourth\\nAmendment) Act, 1975, we do not condone the\\namendment of clause (1) of Article 95 by the\\nSecond Proclamation (Tenth Amendment)\\nOrder, 1977 (Second Proclamation Order No. 1\\nof 1977) which commensurate with Article\\n95(1) as made in the Fourth Amendment along', 'with its English Text.\\n<br>\\nThis would amount to revival of Article\\n95(1) as amended by the Second Proclamation', '(Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976 (Second\\nProclamation Order No. IV of 1976)\\n<br>\\n.....................................................................\\n<br>\\n.................................................................\\n<br>\\n224. Then the High Court Division concluded', 'as follows:\\n<br>\\nWe provisionally condone the various pro-\\nvisions of the Proclamations with amendments\\nas appended to the book, namely, the Constitu-\\ntion of the People Republic of Bangladesh; pub-\\nlished by the Ministry of Law, Justice and\\nParliamentary ~ Affairs, ~Government of\\nBangladesh, as modified upto 31st May, 2000,\\nsave and except those mentioned above. But\\nsince we have declared the Constitution (Fifth\\nAmendment) Act, 1979, wultra vires 10 the\\nConstitution, the vires of the rest of the provi-\\nsions of the Proclamations not considered here-\\nin, remain justifiable before the Court.\\nHowever, all the acts and proceedings taken\\nthereon, although were not considered yet, are\\ncondoned as past and closed transactions.\\n<br>\\nWe have held earlier held in general that\\nthere was no legal existence of Martial Law and\\nconsequently of no Martial Law Authorities, as\\nsuch, all Proclamations etc. were illegal, void ab\\ninitio and non-est in the eye of law. This we\\nhave held strictly in accordance with the dic-\\ntates of the Constitution, the supreme law to', 'which all the Institutions including the Judiciary\\nowe its existence. We are bound to declare what\\nhave to be declared, in vindication of our oath\\ntaken in accordance with the Constitution, oth-\\nerwise, we ourselves would be violating the\\nConstitution and the oath taken to protect the\\nConstitution and thereby betraying the Nation.\\nWe had no other alternative, rather, we are\\nobliged to act strictly in accordance with the\\nprovisions of the Constitution.\\n<br>\\nThe learned Advocates for the petitioners\\nraised the possibility of chaos or confusion that\\nmay arise if we declare the said Proclamations,\\nMLRs and MLOs and the acts taken there under\\nas illegal, void ab initio and non est. We are not\\nunmindful of such an apprehension although\\nunlikely but we have no iota of doubts about the\\nillegalities of those Proclamations etc. What is\\nwrong and illegal shall remain so for ever. There\\ncannot be any acquiescence in case of an ille-\\ngality. It remains illegal for all time to come. A\\nCourt of Law cannot extend benefit to the per-\\npetrators of the illegalities by declaring it legit-\\nimate. It remains illegitimate till eternity. The\\nseizure of power by Khandaker Mushtaque\\nAhmed and his band of renegades, definitely\\nconstituted offences and shall remain so forev-\\ner. No law can legitimize their actions and trans-\\nactions. The Martial Law Authorities in impos-\\ning Martial Law behaved like an alien force\\nconquering Bangladesh all over again, thereby\\ntransforming themselves as usurpers, plain and\\nsimple.\\n<br>\\nBe that as it may, although it is very true\\nthat illegalities would not make such continu-\\nance as a legal one but in order to protect the\\ncountry from irreparable evils flowing from\\nconvulsions of apprehended chaos and confu-\\nsion and in bringing the country back to the road\\nmap devised by its Constitution, recourse to the\\ndoctrine of necessity in the paramount interest\\nof the nation becomes imperative. In such a sit-\\nuation, while holding the Proclamations etc. as\\nillegal and void ab initio, we provisionally con-', '            ', 'done the Ordinances, and provisions of the var-\\nious Proclamations, MLRs and MLOs save and\\nexcept those are specifically denied above, on\\nthe age old principles, such as, Id quod Alias\\nNon Est Licitum, Necessitas Licitum Facit\\n(That which otherwise is not lawful, necessity\\nmakes lawful), Salus populi suprema lex (safe-\\nty of the people is the supreme law) and salus\\nrepublicae est suprema lex (safety of the State is', 'the supreme law).\\n<br>\\nIn this connection it may again be remind-\\ned that those Proclamations etc. were not made\\nby the Parliament but by the usurpers and dicta-\\ntors. To them, we would use Thomas Fullers\\nwarning sounded over 300 years ago: Be you\\never so high, the law is above you. (Qu0t¢d from\\nthe Judgment of Lord Dennings MR, in Gouriet\\nvs Union of Post Office Workers (1977) 1 OB 729\\nat page-762). Fiat justitia, ruat caelum.', '225. Regarding condonation, the High Court\\nDivision, in paragraphs 18-21 of the summary, held', 'as follows:—\\n<br>\\n“18 . The turmoil or crisis in the country is\\nno excuse for any violation of the constitution\\nor its deviation on any pretext. Such turmoil or\\ncrisis must be faced and quelled within the\\nambit of the Constitution and the laws made\\nthere under, by the concerned authorities, estab-\\nlished under the law for such purpose.\\n<br>\\n19 . Violation of the Constitution is a grave\\nlegal wrong and remains so for all time to come.\\nIt cannot be legitimized and shall remain illegit-\\nimate forever, however, on the necessary of the\\nState only, such legal wrongs can be condoned\\nin certain circumstances, invoking the maxims,\\nId quod Alias Non Est Licitum. Necessitas\\nLicitum Facit, salus populi est suprema lex and\\nsalus republicae est suprema lex.\\n<br>\\n20 . As such, all acts and things done and\\nactions and proceedings taken during the period\\nfrom August 15, 1975 to April 9, 1979, are con-\\ndoned as past and closed transactions, but such\\ncondonations are made not because those are\\nlegal but only in the interest of the Republic in\\norder to avoid chaos and confusion in the socie-\\nty, although distantly apprehended, however,\\nthose remain illegitimate and void forever.\\n<br>\\n21 . Condonations of provisions were made,\\namong others, in respect of provisions, deleting\\nthe various provisions of the Fourth Amend-\\nment but no condonation of the provisions was\\nallowed in respect of omission of any provision\\nenshrined in the original Constitution. The\\nPreamble Articles 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,25, 38 and 142\\nremain as it was in the original Constitution. No\\ncondonation is allowed in respect of change of\\nany of these provisions of the Constitution.\\nBesides, Article 95, as amended by the Second\\nProclamation Order No. IV of 1976, is declared', 'valid and retained.”', '226. As it appears, the High Court Division\\naccepted the doctrine of condonation as was done in\\nAsma Jilani’s case and in order to avoid chaos and\\nconfusion in the society and preserve continuity\\ncondoned all acts and thins and proceedings taken\\nduring the period from August 15, 1975 to April 9,\\n1979 as past and closed transactions and in para 21\\nof its summery the High Court Division condoned\\nall the provisions which deleted the various provi-\\nsions of the Fourth Amendment.', 'As it appears, by the Fourth Amendment,', 'amongst others,\\n<br>\\n(1) In place of Parliamentary system,\\nPresidential system was introduced by\\nsubstituting chapter I and II of Part IV of\\nthe Constitution,\\n<br>\\n(2)The impeachment and removal of the\\nPresident was made tougher.', '<br>\\n(3)The power of the Parliament was reduced\\nby amending Article 80.\\n<br>\\n(4)The power of the High Court Division to', 'enforce fundamental rights was curtailed\\nby substituting Article 44.', '            \\n  (5)\\nThe independence of judiciary was cur-\\ntailed by amending Article 95.', '(6)One-party political system was intro-\\nduced by adding part VIA in the Constitu-\\ntion.', '227. It also appears that by the Fifth Amend-\\nment, amongst others, the following changes were\\nmade.\\n<br>', '(1)Omission of Part VIA of the Constitution\\ndealing with one party system as intro-\\nduced by the Fourth Amendment. The\\nabove omission was made by\\nProclamation dated 8th November of\\n1975.\\n<br>\\n(2)Partial restoration of the independence of\\njudiciary (Article 95 and 116) as made by\\nthe Second Proclamation (Seventh\\nAmendment) Order 1976. Independence\\nof judiciary was curtailed by the Fourth\\nAmendment.\\n<br>\\n(3)Restoration of the jurisdiction of the High\\nCourt Division to enforce fundamental\\nrights as was provided in original Articles\\n44 and 102 of the Constitution. The same\\nwas made by the Second Proclamation\\n(Seventh Amendment) Order 1976.\\n<br>\\n(4)Insertion of the provision of Supreme\\nJudicial Council in respect of security of\\ntenure of the judges of the Supreme Court\\n(Article 96). The same was made by\\nProclamation Order No.l of 1977.\\n<br>\\n(5)Abolition of the provision of absolute\\nveto power of the President as introduced\\nby the Fourth Amendment (Article 80).\\nThe same was made by the Second\\nProclamation (Fifteenth Amendment)\\nOrder 1978.\\n<br>\\n(6)Introduction of the provision of referen-\\ndum in respect of amendment of certain\\nprovisions of the Constitution. The same', '            ', 'was made by Second Proclamation Order\\n(Fifteenth Ahmed) 1978 by inserting sub-\\narticles (1A), (1B) and (1C) in Article 142,\\n<br>\\n(7)The insertion of the words “Bismillahir\\nRahmanir Rahim” at the beginning of the\\nConstitution i.e. above the Preamble.\\n<br>\\n(8)Amending the original Article 6 of the\\nConstitution which provided that the citi-\\nzens of Bangladesh would be known as\\n‘Bengalees’ by the substituted Article 6\\nproviding that citizens of Bangladesh\\nwould- be known as ‘Bangladeshis’.\\nFurther original Article 9 of the Constitu-\\ntion, which provided for unity and soli-\\ndarity of the Bengalee nation, was also\\nsubstituted by a new Article providing\\npromoting local governmental institution.\\nThe same was done by Proclamation\\nOrder No.1 of 1977.\\n<br>\\n(9)Omission of secularism as was provided\\nin original Article 8(1) of the Constitution\\nwhich declared that the principles of\\nnationalism, socialism, democracy and\\nsecularism shall constitute the fundamen-\\ntal principles of State Policy; addition of\\nthe words “the principle of absolute trust\\nand faith in the Almighty Allah™ in\\nArticle 8(1) and also the insertion of a\\nnew sub article (1A) containing the\\nwords “Absolute trust and faith in the\\nAlmighty Allah shall be the basis of all\\nactions” after amended Article 8(1). The\\nabove was made by Proclamation Order\\nNo.l of 1977.\\n<br>\\n(10)Giving new explanation to “Socialism”\\nas mentioned in original Article 8(1), one\\nof four major fundamental principles of\\nState Policy, to the effect that socialism\\nwould mean only economic and social\\njustice. \\n<br>\\n(11)Substitution of original Article 10 of the\\nConstitution which guaranteed democra-', '            ', 'cy and human rights by a new Article pro-\\nviding “Participation of women in nation-\\nal life” which has no nexus with the orig-\\ninal Article 9.\\n<br>\\n(12) Omission of the proviso t0 Article 38\\nfrom the original Constitution which pro-', 'vided as follows:—\\n<br>\\n“Provided that no person shall ha\\nright to form, of be a member or other-', 'wise take part in the activities of, any\\ncommunal or other association or union\\nwhich in the name or on the basis of any\\nreligion has for its object, or pursuces, a\\npolitical purpose.” The same Was made\\nby the Second Proclamation (Sixth', 'Amendment) Order 1976.\\n<br>\\n(13) Addition of new Article 92A giving the\\nPresident the power to expend public\\nmoneys in certain cases even without the\\napproval of the Parliament. The said\\nArticle 92A was inserted in the\\nConstitution by the Second Proclamation\\n(Fifteenth Amendment) Order 1978.', '<br>\\n(14) Inserting of another new Article 145A\\nproviding that all international treaties\\nwould be submitted to the President who\\nshould cause them to be laid before\\nParliament by second proclamation. The\\nsaid Article 145A was inserted in the\\nConstitution by the Second Proclamation\\n(Fifteenth Amendment) Order 1978.\\n<br>\\n(15) Amendment of Article 58 of the\\nConstitution providing that four-fifih of\\nthe total number of ministers should be\\ntaken from among the members of Parlia-\\nment and that the President would\\nappoint as Prime Minister a member of\\nparliament who appeared to him to com-\\nmand the support of the majority of the\\nmembers of parliament. The same was\\nmade by the Second Proclamation\\n(Fifteenth Amendment) Order 1978.', '', '228. A question has been raised as to whether\\nthe High Court Division can exercise the “legisla-\\ntive p()wcr\" by way of condonation. But it is now\\nsettled to avoid anomaly and also to preserve conti-\\nnuity, the Courts have to pass consequential orders.\\nNo exception can be taken to it. Ilustrations of such\\njudicial power may be found in the Eighth Amend-\\nment case wherein the Appellant Division ordered\\nprospective application of the invalidity of the\\nEighth Amendment. Further while declaring any\\nlaw wltra vires, the Court often applies the doctrine\\nof severability to limit the application of the judicial\\nverdict. This is no legislative act though such a deci-\\nsion modifies or even destroys a legislation.', '229. Now regarding the modifications of the judgment\\nand order of the High Court Division it may be nolcd that ear-\\nlier to avoid the hardship that\\nthe people may suffer, we\\nare inclined to condone the substituted provision of\\nArticle 6 of the Constitution. We have also expunged the findings of', 'the High Court Division made in respect of Article\\n150 of the Constitution and the Fourth Schedule tak-\\ning in view of the subsequent development.', '230. The other modifications that we want to\\nmake are in respect of the following provisions of\\nthe Constitution.', \"231. As it appears Part 11 of the Constitution\\nenumerates a host of fundamental rights in which\\nthe framers of the Constitution made the right to\\nmove the Supreme Court of Bangladesh for enforce-\\nment of fundamental rights itself a fundamental\\nright. But as discussed earlier, the same was substi-\\ntuted by the Fourth Amendment providing that the\\n“Parliament may by law establish a Constitutional\\nCourt, Tribunal or Commission for the enforcement\\nof the rights conferred by this part™. But the English\\nText of this Article was substituted by the Second\\nProclamation (Seventh Amendment) Order, 1976\\nand the Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment)\\nOrder, 1977 and the Bengali Text was substituted by\\nthe Second Proclamation (Fifteenth Amendmenl')\\nOrder, 1978 and by these amendments the original\\nArticle 44 was restored. As a result a citizen of\", '            \\nBangladesh is entitled to move the High Court\\ndivision under Article 102 for the enforcement of\\n(he rights conferred in Part 111, This substitution of\\nArticle 44, no doubt, was designed to advance rule\\nof law and the welfare of the people and according-\\nly it needs to be retained for the interest of justice.', '232. It also appears that the provision of\\nArticle 96 as existed in the Constitution on August\\n15, 1975 provided that a Judge of the Supreme Court\\nof Bangladesh may be removed from the office by the\\nPresident on the ground of “misbehavior or incapac-\\nity”. However clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of\\nArticle 96 were substituted by the Second Procla-\\nmation (Tenth Amendment) Order, 1977 providing\\nthe procedure for removal of a Judge of the Supreme\\nCourt of Bangladesh by the Supreme Judicial Council\\nin the manner provided therein instead of earlier\\nmethod of removal. This substituted provisions being\\nmore transparent procedure than that of the earlier\\nones and also safeguarding independence of judici-\\nary, are to be condoned.', '233. Earlier while discussing the different\\nProclamations, Martial Law Regulations and Orders\\nwe found that under the Constitution of 1972 the\\nHigh Court Division, under original Article 102(1),\\nhad powers to pass necessary orders to enforce fun-\\ndamental rights. It may be noted here that this power\\nof the High Court Division is not discretionary and\\nwhenever an authority acts illegally or commits an\\nerror of law or a citizen’s fundamental right is vio-\\nlated, the remedy under this article can be availed of.\\nThis sub-article (1) of Article 102 though was delet-\\ned by the Fourth Amendment has been restored by\\nthe Second Proclamation (Tenth Amendment)\\nOrder, 1977. The above restoration of sub-article (1)\\nof Article 102, being beneficial, should be condoned\\nfor the wider public interest.', '234. It also appears that Part VIA of the\\nConstitution under the heading ‘THE NATIONAL\\nPARTY’ incorporating Article 117A was added by\\nthe Fourth Amendment. However in a democratic\\nsystem the existence of different political parties\\nand their participation in the parliamentary election\\ncannot be denied because such participation would\\nflourish the democracy in the country, Further this\\nArticle 117A is also inconsistent with Articles 37,\\n38, 39 of the Constitution. However this provision\\nhas been deleted by the Proclamation dated 8th\\nNovember, 1975. Accordingly this portion of the\\nabove Proclamation needs to be condoned.', '235.  As it appears Article 95 of the Constitu-\\ntion, relates to the appointment of the Judges of the\\nSupreme Court of Bangladesh, The above Article 95\\nas it stood after the amendment made by the Second\\nProclamation (Seventh Amend- ment) Order, 1976\\nhas been retained by the High Court Division. The\\nabove Order, amongst others, changed Article 95 of\\nthe Constitution relating to the appointment of\\nJudges of the Supreme Court. This amendment of\\nArticle 95 commensurate with the Original Article\\n95 which existed before the enactment of the Fourth\\nAmendment wherein there was provision for the\\nappointment of the Judges by the President “after\\nconsultation with the Chief Justice™. But this con-\\nsultative provision as provided by Second\\nProclamation (Seventh Amendment Order 1977)\\nwas deleted by the Second Proclamation (Tenth\\nAmendment) Order, 1977. Accordingly, after the\\namendment of the amended Article 95 by the\\nSecond Proclamation (Tenth Amendment) Order.\\n1977, Article 95 as amended by the Second\\nProclamation Order No. IV of 1976, did no longer\\nexist, and therefore, it was not ratified or validated\\nor confirmed by the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly\\nthis Article 95 as amended by the Second\\nProclamation Order No. IV of 1976 could not be\\nlegally condoned by the High Court Division as it\\nwas not in force on the day the Fifth Amendment\\nwas passed. Moreso, a repealed provision cannot be\\nlegally retained alid/or validated by the Court. So\\nArticle 95 will remain as it existed on August 15,\\n1975. However, in view of the declarations given in\\nthe Judges case (Supra) declaring that convention of\\nconsultation being, a Constitutional imperative, is\\nbinding upon everybody. Accordingly this retention\\nof substituted Article 95 will have no bearing on the\\nmatter of consultation.', '            \\n236. However, before concluding we would\\nlike to mention that our decision will remain incom-\\nplete if we do not mention the present state of the\\nJjudiciary in the Constitution.', '237.  As it appears Mustafa Kamal, CJ was\\nemphatic in respect of the independence of the judi-\\nciary in Secretary of Finance vs Masdar Hossain\\n2000 BLT (4D) 23¢ wherein he held in para 44, page', '257 — 258 as follows:\\n<br>\\n“44_ The independence of the judiciary, as\\naffirmed and declared by Articles 94(4) and\\n116A . is one of the basic pillars of the\\nConstitution and cannot be demolished, whit-\\ntled down, curtailed or diminished in any man-\\nner whatsoever, except under the existing provi-\\nsion of the Constitution. It is true that this inde-\\npendence, as emphasized by the learned\\nAttorney-General , is subject to the provision of', 'the Constitution, but we find no provision in the\\nConstitution which curtails, demolishes to oth-\\nerwise abridges this independence...... N\\n<br>\\nHowever we are of the view that the words,\\n“but we find no provision in the Constitution which\\ncurtzils, demolishes or otherwise abridges this inde-\\npendence” do not depict the actual picture because\\nunless Articles 115 and 116 are restored to their\\noriginal position, independence of judiciary will not\\nbe fully achieved.', '238. In this regard, Matin, J in Judges Case /7\\nBLT (AD) 231 observed as follows:\\n<br>\\n“it is true that “consultation” was consid-\\nered in the light of Article 116 of the\\nConstitution but never the less the same princi-\\nple all the more applies in the matter of appoint-\\nment of Judges of the Supreme Court under\\nArticles 95 and 98 of the Constitution because\\nwithout the independence of the Supreme Court\\nthere cannot be any independence of the subor-\\ndinate Courts and minus the consultation and\\np.rimacy the separation of judiciary from execu-\\ntive will be empty words........ ', '', \"230. It was further observed:—\\n<br>\\n“we agree, with approval, with Justice\\nBhagvati and add further that although Article\\n92 has been implemented to a great extent\\nthrough the judgment of this Court in Masdar\\nHossain's case but until and unless the unmend-\\ned Articles 115 and 116 of the Constitution are\\nrestored vesting the control of the subordinate\\njudiciary in the Supreme Court, the separation\\nof judiciary will remain a distant cry and a\\nmusic of the distant drum”\\n<br>\\nIt may be noted here that among the twelve\", 'directions given in Masdar Hossains case one was\\nto the effect that Parliament will in its wisdom take\\nnecessary steps regarding this aspect of independence of judiciary.', '\\n240. It is our Earnest hope that Articles 115\\nand 116 of the Constitution will be restored to their\\noriginal position by the Parliament as soon as possible', '241. Before we conclude, we would like to\\nquote the following:\\n<br>\\n“The greatest of all the means .......... for\\nensuring the stability of Constitution-but which\\nis now a days generally neglected is the educa-\\ntion of citizens in the spirit of the Constitution\\n............ To live by the rule of the Constitution\\nought not to be regarded as slavery, but rather as\\nsalvation.” (Aristotle’s Politics (335-322 BC)\\npp 233-34”', '242. We would also quote the following pas-\\nsage from the conclusion in an essay on Noni\\nPalkivala in ....oooviiininnn “Democracy, Human\\nrights and Rule of Law™ edited by Venkat lyer ,\\n2000 regarding the “Period of Delinquency\" in India', 'in 1975 -1977:\\n<br>\\nDespite the traumatic events of 1995 -\\n1977, the lessons of that emergency have now,\\nalas, also been forgotten by a vast majority of\\nIndian citizenry. It is said that people do not', '            ', \"\\nrealize the benefits of freedom until they are\\nlost. Twenty-five ycars have passed and a new\\ngeneration of Indians is not even aware of what\\nhappened during those cventful months.\\n<br>\\nIt is essential that if India is to preserve her\\ndemocratic freedom, cach generation must be\\ntaught, cducated and informed about those dark\\ndays. Every Indian needs to renew and refresh\\nhimself at the springs of freedom. '\\n<br>\\nWe will simply echo those words by replacing the\\nperiod and the word India with Bangladesh, We\\nemphasize cach of our generation must be taught, edu-\\ncated and informed about those dark days: the easiest\\nway of doing this is to recognize our errors of the past\\nand reflect this sentiments in our judgment. This will\", 'ensure that the sovereignty of “we, the people of', 'Bangladesh” is preserved forever as a “ pole star”.', '243.

The short facts of the case are as under:-\\nThe deceased Joyanti Munshi daughter of informant\\nLusil Sadekin was an Architect and Senior Teacher\\nof Australian International School at Gulshan,\\nDhaka. On 10-3-2000 her marriage with accused\\nAzam Reza was solemnized. After marriage they\\nhad a happy conjugal life for 3'/, years. The\\ndeceased used to live in the house of the accused.\\nShe gave birth to a son named Turja by the accused.\\nAt the time of occurrence Turja was 2/, years of\\nage. In the meantime, illicit relationship developed\\nbetween the accused and Afsana Mimi, an actress, in\\nsc'quel of which the accused started misbehaving\\nwith and torturing the deceased. On the night fol-\\nlowing 8-1-2004 in the bedroom the accused\\nassaulting the deceased intentionally caused her\\ndeath,\", \"5. On 9-1-2004 at 1-30 PM Shampa Reza, the\\nsister of the accused, over telephone informed Mr\\nMaht?ubur Rahman, husband of Dr Shati Munshi,\\nthe s!stcr to the decease had committed suicide by\\nhanging. Dr Mahbabur Rahman and Dr Shati\\nlnforrned the matter to the mother of the deceased,\\nthe informant. Then they went to the house of the\\nac.cusc':d and found the dead body of the deceased\\nlying in the bedroom on a cot with some injuries on\", 'the different parts of the body including one\\nswelling on the back of the head.', '6. On the same day at about 3-25 PM before\\narrival of the informant party the accused in writing\\ninformed Gulshan Police Station that the deceased\\ncommitted suicide by hanging. On the basis of\\nwhich Unnatural Death Case No.2 of 2004 was\\nrecorded and SI Biman Kumar Das was entrusted\\nwith the investigation of the same, who went to the\\nhouse of the accused and made inquest of the dead\\nbody of the deceased at 4-05 PM and sent the dead\\nbody to the morgue for post-mortem examination\\nfor ascertaining the cause of death. He seized one\\noma, a revolving chair and a cot as alamats from the\\nplace of occurrence bedroom under a seizure list and\\nrecorded the statements of the maid servants, the\\nfirst wife, sister and driver of the accused and others\\nunder section 161 of the Code of Criminal', 'Procedure.', '7. At about 8-25 PM the informant filed a\\nwritten complaint with Gulshan Police Station\\nagainst the accused alleging that he caused the death\\nof the deceased, but the police did not record the\\ncase treating the written complaint as FIR. They\\nrecorded that written complaint as GD Entry No.\\n690 dated 9-1-2004 on the plea that an unnatural\\ndeath case had already been recorded. A Medical\\nBoard held autopsy of the dead body of the deceased\\nand reported that death of the deceased was due 1o\\nthe head injury, which was homicidal. Next day on\\n10-1-2004 at 11-15 PM the informant lodged anoth-\\ner written complaint with Gulshan Police Station\\nagainst the accused, on the basis of which a regular\\nmurder case was recorded. Accordingly final report\\nwas submitted in the Unnatural Death Case. After\\ninvestigation of the murder case charge sheet was\\nsubmitted against the accused, who eventually was\\nput on trial in the Druto Bichar Tribunal No.4,\\nDhaka, wherein charge under sections 302 and 201\\nof the Penal Code was framed against him to which\\nhe pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.', '8. The defence case is that of innocence and\\nfalse implication and that the deceased committed\\nsuicide by hanging.', '            ', '9. At the trial in order to prove the charge the\\nprosecution examined 13 witnesses, of whom PW I\\nLusil Sadekin is the informant and mother of the\\ndeceased, PW 2 Dr Shati Munshi is the sister of P\\\\WV\\n6 Dr Mabubur Rahman is her husband. PW 3\\nMofezzelatunnessa Doly and her sister PW §\\nFazilatunnessa are the relatives of the deceased. PW\\n4 Dr Mahbub Ahmed is the house physician of the\\naccused.

Afier closing of the prosecution evidence\\nthe accused was examined under section 342 of the\\nCode of Criminal Procedure, when he submitted a\\nwritten statement contending that the deceased com-\\nmitted suicide by hanging. He filed some documents\\nincluding the certified copies of the statements of\\nhis domestic helps Alpana, Nurunnahar, Nayantara\\nand Sabina Begum, his first wife Atia Sultana and\\nsister Shampa Reza recorded under section 161 of\\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure in connection with\\nthe Unnatural Death Case by PW 10 SI Biman\\nKumar Das on 9-1-2004 and also the statements of\\nhis domestic helps Nayantara, Alpana. Nurunnahar\\nand driver Khorshed Alam, Shahadat Hossain, a key\\nmaker, the security guards and supervisor of apart-\\nment building where he lived, recorded under sec-', 'tions 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal\\nProcedure in the present case and also some papers\\nof Ramna Police Station Case No. 24-1-2004, arose\\nout of the incident of road accident the ambulance\\ncarrying the dead body of the deccased to the', 'morgue faced.', '11. The learned Judge on consideration of the\\nevidences on record and the facts and circumstances\\nof the case convicted and sentenced the accused as\\nforesaid and made the reference under section 374\\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure for confirmation\\nof the sentence of death awarded to the accused.\\nBeing aggrieved by and dissatisfied with that judg-\\nment and order of conviction and sentence he con-\\nvict preferred the above regular appeal as well as the', 'jail appeal.', '12. The High Court Division after hearing the\\nreference and the appeal and the jail appeal held as\\nunder:\\n<br>\\n“The above evidence of PWs 1-6 as to\\npresence of marks of hurt on the person of the\\ndeceased her normal eyes, nose etc and absence\\nof any the symptoms of death by hanging are\\nnot tainted and do not suffer from any infirmity.\\nMoreover their such evidence had gone unchal-\\nlenged. Therefore, there is no reason to discard\\nthe same.”', '13. The High Court Division further held that\\nthe death of the deceased could not be attributed to\\nhanging as under:\\n<br>\\n“In the instant case besides the ligature\\nmark other signs and symptoms of death due to\\nhanging like (1) petichial haemorrhage and\\necchymoises anterior around the ligature mark,\\n(2) mark of dribbled saliva, (3) tear of the inti-\\nma of carotid arteries with extravasations of\\nblood with their walks, (4) congested and\\nhaemorhage in the lymph nodes above and\\nbelow the ligature mark, () fracture or disloca-\\ntion of cervical vertebra and both external and\\ninternal injuries on head were present. So in the\\npresent case the death of the deceased could not\\nbe attri-buted to hanging.”', '            ', '\\n14. The High Court Division afier considering\\nthe medical evidence about the haematoma held as\\nunder :\\n<br>\\n“In view of the authorities of medical\\njurisprudence quoted above without any frac-\\nture of the skull and injury on the meninges\\nhemorrhage may be occurred on the brain\\nresulting instantaneous death. The haematoma\\non the right parieto-occipital area and a sub-\\narachnoid hemorrhage in the right parietal and\\nboth frontal lobes clearly show that a blow with\\nhard substance was given on the parieto-occipi-\\ntal region resulted sub-arachnoid hemorrhage\\non the right parietal and both the frontal lobes\\nand such sub-arachnoids hemorrhage caused\\ncerebral failure resulting death of the deceased.\\nSo there is no reason to discard the medical evi-\\ndence as to cause of death. The doctors rightly\\nopined that the death of the deceased was due to\\nhead injuries, which was ante-mortem and\\nhomicidal in nature. In this way we are unable\\nto agree with above submission of Mr.\\nKhandker Mahbub Hossain. Thus it is well\\nestablished that the deceased was done to death.\\nAfter intentionally causing the death of the\\ndeceased, in order to colour such homicidal\\ndeath as suicidal one the dead body was hanged.\\nThus the prosecution could prove beyond all\\nreasonable doubt that the offence of murder was\\ncommitted.”', '15. In the instant case, the death of the\\ndeceased Joyanti Munshi in the bedroom of her hus-\\nband accused Azam Reza is not disputed. According\\nto the prosecution she was assaulted to death. On the\\nother hand, the defence is that she committed sui-\\ncide by hanging. The deceased was the wife of the\\naccused who met with death in the bedroom of the\\naccused, while she was living with the accused. The\\npresence of the accused in the house at the material\\ntime is not disputed rather is supported and proved\\nby evidence on record and the death of the deceased\\nwas within the special knowledge of the accused.\\nThe accused came out with the story of suicide by\\nhanging which he failed to prove and as such the', 'High Court Division rightly held the accused guilty\\nof murder.', '16. As to sentence the High Court Division\\nheld as under :\\n<br>\\n“The accused is not a hardened criminal.\\nThe death of the deceased was caused by him in\\nsequel of bitter matrimonial relationship. He\\ncaused the haematoma with any hard substance\\non the occipital region on the head of the decea-\\nsed which resulted her instantaneous death. The\\naccused has three minor children and an invalid\\nfirst wife. In view of these facts and circum-\\nstances, we are of the view that justice will be\\nmet if the sentence of death awarded to the\\naccused is commuted to imprisonment for life.”', '17.

So in the said corrigendum it was published\\nthat the record date for the 20th, 21st and 22nd\\nAGMs were fixed on 25-9-2005. In the said public\\nnotice dated 13-9-2005 for the 20th, 21st and 22nd\\nAGMs a representation was made by the Company\\nthat “the shareholders whose names would appear in\\nthe Register of Member of the Company on the\\nRecord Date shall be entitled to the dividend and to\\nattend the Meeting”. The said AGM notices were\\nmore or less in identical terms.', '6.  Havingrelied on the representation made\\nby the respondent No. 18 Company in the AGM\\nnotices dated 12-9-2005 and corrigendum dated 15-\\n9-2005 to the effect that shareholders whose names\\nwould appear in the share register book and deposi-\\ntory shall be entitled to dividend and vote in the\\nAGMs for the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs, the\\nrespondent petitioners after the Day of Record Date,\\nsold their entire shares on the understanding and\\nconsideration that they would receive the dividend/\\nbonus shares from the respondent No. 18- Company\\nsince as on the day of 25-9-2005 the share register\\nbook of the respondent No. 18 Company reflected\\ntheir names as shareholders against the said shares.', '7. Thereafter, on 26-9-2005 after the expiry\\nof the record date i.e. 25-9-2005, one Mr Md Nur\\nUddin Javed filed Company Matter No. 134 before\\nthe High Court Division under section 81 read with\\nsection 85(3) of the Companies Act, 1994 for the\\ncondonation of delay for the 20th, 21st and 22nd\\nAGMs on the allegation that without holding the\\nAGMs for the years 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 the\\nAGMs for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 ie. of', '            ', '\\n20th, 21th and 22nd AGMs cannot be held under\\n:,ction 81 of the Companies Act, 1994.

The said matter was filed after expiry of\\nrecord date i.e. 25-9-2005. As such the record date\\nwas never stayed. Rather all shareholders acted\\nupon the said record date by way of getting their\\nnzmes registered as shareholders in the share regis-\\nter book or depository book and some shareholders\\nalso further acted upon the said recorded date i.e.\\n25-9-2005 by way of disposing of some of their\\nshareholding after expiry of record date, since on the\\nbasis of representation of the respondent No. 18\\nCompany the shareholders whose names appear in\\nthe share register book as on the day of 25-9-2005\\nwould be entitled to dividend and vote irrespective\\nof the fact of disposing of their shareholding.', '9. Thereafter the High Court Division by\\nJjudgment dated 26-11-2007 in the Company Matter\\nNo. 134 of 2005 and Company Matter No. 149 of\\n2007 condoned the delay for calling and holding the\\ns2id 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs. Pursuant to the said\\ncondonation of delay by the High Court Division,\\nthe Board of Directors of the respondent No. 18\\nCompany vide resolution dated 26-12-2007 took\\ndeision to hold the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs on\\n10-1-2008. The record date for the said 20th, 21st\\nand 22nd AGMs was not changed.', '10. Therefore, the respondent No, 18\\nCompany keeping the record dated as it is i.e. 25-9-\\n2005 published notices for 20th, 21st and 22nd\\nAGMs held on 10-1-2008 in the “The Financial\\nExpress” dated 27.12-2007. In the said AGM\\nnotices - dated 27-12-2007 it was stated that\\ner and the Will remain 25-9-2005 as declared earlier\\nand the shareholders whose names appeared in\\nthe register of the members of the Company or in the\\ndespository as on the record date i.e. 25-9-2005 shall\\nbe entitled to  dividend and vote in the said AGMs.\\nThe said notices were more or less in identical terms.', '11. The respondent No, 18 Company as per\\nlaws relating to Securities and Exchange Commis-\\nsion published a public notice dated 26-12-2007 as\\nprice sensitive information for the 20th, 21st and\\n22nd AGMs in the Financial Express dated 27-12-\\n2007. In the said price sensitive information it was\\nalso stated that the record date for the 20th, 21st and\\n22nd AGMs will remain 25-9-2005 as declared ear-\\nlier and shareholders whose names appeared in the\\nregister of the member of the Bank on the record\\ndate i.e. 25-9-2005 will be eligible to attend the\\nmeetings and qualify to stock dividend/bonus share.', '12.  On the basis of the representation of the\\nrespondent No. 18 Company by way of public\\nnotices from time to time, the appellants were\\nassured that they will be entitled to dividend/bonus\\nshare and right to vote in the 20th, 21st and 22nd\\nAGMs even after any share is sold out after the\\nrecord dated i.e. 25-9-2005 provided their names\\nappear in the share register book of the Company as\\non the date of 25-9-2005. As such, having relief on\\nsuch representation the appellants sold out their\\nentire shares after the record date i.e. 25-9-2005\\npassed.', \"13. However, the respondent Nos. 1 to 17\\npurchased their shareholding after the record date\\ni.e. 25-9-2005. The names of the respondent Nos. 1\\nto 17 did not appear in the share register book of the\\nCompany or depository as on the date of record\\ndated i.e. 25-9-2005.

Thereafter, the appellant in Civil Appeal\\nNo. 319 of 2008 having learnt about the initiation of\\nthe said Company Matter No. | of 2008 filed an\\napplication for addition of party as added respon-\\ndent before the High Court Division since change of\\nrecord date will prejudice the vested right of the\\nappellant acquired in getting dividend and attending\\nin the said 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs against the\\nshares sold out after the record date i.e. 25-9-2005\\nrelying on the representations of the respondent No.\\n18 Company and as per the law of the land.

The High Court Division having heard\\nthe parties at length by judgment and order dated 11-\\n6-2008 declared the fixation of record date on 25-9-\\n2005 for holding the 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs of\\nthe respondent No. 18 Company as illegal and\\ndirected to prepare fresh balance sheet and also\\ndirected to fix record date for the said 20th, 21st and', '22nd AGMs afresh.', '18.

He further submitted that the High Court\\npivision committed serious error of law in dispos-\\ning of the aforesaid Company matters with direc-\\ntions, travelling beyond its jurisdiction and ignoring\\nthe settled principles of law that it cannot grant any\\nrelief unless the reliefs sought come strictly within\\nthe four corners of the Companies Act, especially\\nsections 81, 85(3) and 396 of the said Act as in the\\npresent case, which resulted in an error in the deci-\\nsion, occasioning failure of justice.', '21.  He submitted that the directions given by\\nthe High Court Division in disposing of the instant\\nCompany matters are arbitrary, devoid of logic and\\nbased on misappreciation of the provisions of law,\\nwhich is erroneous and requires interference of this\\nCourt for the ends of justice.', '22.  He submitted that the provisions of sec-\\ntions 41, 85(3) and 396 of the Companies Act have\\nbeen introduced in the statute to obviate some difTi-\\ncult situations in order to facilitate smooth function-\\ning of the companies and to ensure that proper\\naccounts are kept and the same is informed to the\\nmembers of the Company through AGMs, if those\\ncould not be held within the stipulated time. But the\\nimpugned erroneous judgment of the High Court\\nDivision, instead of ensuring smooth functioning of\\nthe Company only made it more complicated, occa-\\nsioning failure of justice which requires interference\\nfor the ends of justice.', '23.  He submitted that the section 14 of the\\nDepositories Act 1999 (VI of 1999) empowers the\\n_SEC to give orders to issuers of shares relating to the\\ninterest of investors or smooth development. The\\nSEC by clause 2 of Notification No. SEC/CMR-\\nRCD/2001-14/24/Admin/03-03 dated 26-11-2001\\nordered that any decision about recommending or\\nnot recommending dividend and entitlement for\\nSUFh dividend if recommended cannot be changed\\nprior to holding of the AGM. Clause 2 of the said\\nnotification was absolute in nature and left no room\\nfor any variable or imponderables or contingencies.\\nAdditionally on 18-7-2004, the SEC pursuant to the\\nsaid section 14 ordered that the listed companies\\nwould declare Record Date instead of Book Closure\\nfor the purposes of Corporate Declaration (Dividend\\nete.) and that shareholders having their names regis-\\ntered in the Register of Members on Record Date\\nwould be entitled to dividend. The impugned judg-\\nment and order having disregarded the absolute\\nnature of the said notifications, in an error of law.', '24.  He submitted that the issue of the Record\\nDate is a matter relating to the internal management\\nof a limited Company in view of the Articles of the\\nCompany which place all issues relating to Divi-\\ndend within the exclusive discretion of the Board of\\nDirectors of the Company (the relevant Articles\\nbeing 124 to 142 of the Articles of Association of\\nUCBL). It is settled law that the Company Court has\\nno jurisdiction either in law or in fact to deal with\\nany matter relating to the internal management of a\\nlimited Company. In declaring that the Record Date\\nset by the Board of Directors as 25-9-2005 was ille-\\ngal and in directing the re-fixing of the Record Date\\nwithin 15 to 21 days of the AGMs the High Court\\nDivision has erred in law and in fact.', '25. He submitted that the Public Notices\\ndated 13-9-2005 and 27-12-2007 published by the\\nCompany pursuant to the SEC Notifications dated\\n26-11-2001 and 18-7-2004 are clear Members as on\\n25-9-2005 to attend the AGM for the relevant years\\nand that those shareholders will be getting any divi-\\ndend recommended by the Board of Directors\\napproved by the AGM. Relying upon the said repre-\\nsentation, the petitioner and other small investors\\nsold their shares in the Company after the public\\nannouncement and suffered detriment as the value\\nof X/D or Ex-Dividend shares are always lower.\\nTherefore the Company should be estopped from\\nseeking to or changing the Record Date of 25-9-\\n2005 as fixed and made public earlier.', '26. He submitted that the granting applica-\\ntions for condonation of delay under section 81 and\\n85 of the Companies Act 1994 with consequential\\ndirection to change the Record Date to a later date', '            ', \"will leave any and all listed companies at liberty l})\\ndelay the holding of AGMs within the slnlutor)'f peri-\\nod and apply for such consequential dirccn.on to\\nchange the Record Date to one which best suits the\\nsharc‘holdcrs directors of listed companies and also\\nopen a flood gate for condonation applications.\", '27.  He submitted that accounts and balance\\nsheets of a particular financial year for a Company,\\nonce audited and certified by the auditors and\\napproved by the Board of Directors are published\\nand become public documents and, as such, cannot\\nbe altered. As prescribed by section 38 of the Bank-\\ning Companies Act 1991, Accounts and Balance\\nSheets are prepared at the expiry of each financial\\nyear contains events that have actually taken place\\nin the relevant accounting year. Any direction to pre-\\npare fresh balance sheets for a particular financial\\nyear to reflect events afterwards will be against the\\nsaid 1991 Act and relevant accounting principles\\nand additionally will have under tax law implica-\\ntions. Indeed, the Company was categorically\\nadvised by Hoda Vasi Chowdhury & Company on\\n16-1-2008 that preparing fresh balance sheet for\\nyears for which accounts have been audited and\\napproved.', '28.  He lastly submitted that the respondents\\nlacked locus standi to ask for a direction to prepare\\nbalance sheets and profit and loss accounts afresh\\nand change the Record Date since they were not\\nmembers of the Company at those relevant times.', '29.

It appears that the High Court Division\\nconsidered the question of maintainability of the\\npetitions under sections 81(2) and 85(3) of the Act\\nand held as under :\\n<br>\\n“For reasons already stated and the satis-\\nfaction above expressed with regard to the sub-\\nmissions made by Dr Zahir on this issue of the\\npetitioners’ /ocus standi in Matter Nos. 1, 10\\nand 11 of 2008, this Court finds that even given\\nthe absence of the amendments that could have\\notherwise been introduced into the Act follow-\\ning the Indian example, the depository regime\\ninherently and implicitly allows for an interpre-\\ntation to be accorded to the relevant provisions\\nas above referred to the 1999 Act and 2003\\nRegulations in a manner as facilitate a harmo-\\nnious relationship between the depository and\\ncompanies law regimes and allow for most of\\nthe petitioners in Matter Nos. 1, 10 and 11 of\\n2008 to be treated as members of the bank\\nenjoying both corporate rights and benetits.\\nIndeed, and it may in the future be considered\\nby lawmakers prudent to do so, amendments by\\nway of abundant caution could have been intro-\\nduced into the Act, but failing or pending such\\nexercise, in this Court’s opinion, there is noth-\\ning in the depository regime that shows that the\\nexisting legal framework is not sufticiently ade-\\nquate to clothe most of the petitioners in gener-\\nal and beneficial owners in a Company in par-\\nticular with the status of membership of a', 'Company.\\n<br>\\nAccordingly, on the question of maintain-\\nability of the three applications in Matter Nos.\\n1, 10 and 11 of 2008, this Court finds that all\\npetitioners, save only those as are identificd\\nhereinafter, are found to be shareholders in the\\nbank as substantiated by information provided', '            \\n to this Court pertaining to the details of the\\nsharcholding in terms of UCB folio numbers\\nand beneficial ownership (B/o) IDs and are\\nthereby entitled to bring these applications\\nunder sections 81(2) and 85(3) of the Act.”', \"46. On question of Record Date the High\\nCourt Division considered the provision of section\\n46(2) of the 2003 regulations and held as under :\\n<br>\\n“In light of the above, this Court finds that\\ndriven by a misconception of applicable law\\nand proceeding on the wrong premise by rely-\\ning on the SEC’s opinion of 9-12-2007, the\\nBoD of the Bank exercised its jurisdiction erro-\\nneously under Regulation 46(2) of the 2003\\nRegulations in maintaining the Record Date of\\n25.9-2005 for the delayed AGMs scheduled to\\nbe held in January, 2008. At this juncture this\\nCourt is necessarily reminded of the steps\\nalready taken by this Court to variously retrain\\nthe bank from carrying out the business at the\\n20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs as were held but\\nwere adjourned only with regard to the agenda\\non the consideration of the financial statements\\nand the declaration of dividend/bonus share,\\nand in that regard remains satisfied of the fact\\nthat by reason of such partial adjournment of\\nthe AGMs otherwise held further to its judg-\\nment and orders dated 26-11-2007 in Matter\\nNos. 134 of 2005 and 149 of 2007 this Court to\\ndate remains in seisin of the matters of the fur-\\nther conduct of business pertaining or in rela-\\ntion to such of the adjourned agenda of the\\nAGMs, In this regard it is 1o be particularly\\nnoted that the orders of admission of this Court\\nin all four matters under consideration were\\n' made at a time when the question or issue of the\", 'legality of maintaining the Record Date of 25-', '9-2005 and the repercussions or reverberations', \"thereof obviously remained determinable 'by\\nthis Court at a future date. It is on that premise\\nthat this Court in the said admission orders ar?d\\nin securing the interest of the bank in gcncra! in\\nkeeping its internal mechanism running\\nallowed for the meetings of 10-1-2008 and 31-\\n1-2008 to be held, albeit on the basis of trun-\", '            \\n            cated agenda to be variously considered in\\neach. The bank was restrained under all four\\napplications from transacting business under\\nthe agenda on which the issue of the Record\\nDate of 25-9-2005 was initially thought to have\\nhad an impact or bearing upon. On a substan-\\ntive consideration of all the four applications\\nand appreciation of the fact that the Record\\nDate as now found to have been maintained at\\n25-9-2005 without any legal basis, but that on\\n-reliance of the same certain business has\\nalready, however, been transacted in the meet-\\nings held on 10-1-2008 and 31-1-2008, this\\nCourt must now necessarily find that the opera-\\ntion of the Record Date of 25-9-2005 at those\\nmeetings as the prime determinant of dividends\\nof certain groups of shareholders of the bank\\nwas without any legal basis. That being the\\ncase, this Court now finds that any business\\ntransacted at the said meetings of 10-1-2008\\nand 31-1-2008 must necessarily be held not to\\nhave been in accordance with law. In light of\\nthe same, and as submitted by both Dr Zahir\\nand Mr Mahmud, it shall be and is within this\\nCourt’s jurisdiction in keeping with the judg-\\nments in Satish Chandra Banik vs Dhaka Jute\\nMills Ltd. reported in PLD 1968 Dacca 610 =\\n19 DLR 280 and Ghyasuddin Ahmed vs\\nFaruque reported in 38 DLR. (AD) 1986, 296 to\\ndirect the bank to call, hold and conduct afresh\\nthe 20th, 21st and 22nd AGMs for the culcnq-.lr\\nyears 2003, 2004 and 2005 in complmm::: with\\nthe directives of this Court as hereunder.', '47. It further appears that the High Court\\nDivision considered the power of the Company\\nBench in giving ancillary directives in the matter of', 'holding AGMs and after considering the provision', 'of section 85(3) of the Companies Act held as under:<br>\\n“The Company Court has ample power 10', 'give ancillary directives in the matter of holding\\nAGMs under section 85(3) Companies Act; the\\nCourt may order a meeting of the Company to', 'be called, held and conducted in such manner', 'as it thinks fit and give such ancillary directions', 'as in thinks expedient. This was so held in the', '            ', 'case of Satish Chandra Banik vs Dhaka Jute\\nMills Ltd reported in PLD 1968 (Dac) 610 = 19\\nDLR 280 and Ghiasuddin Ahmed vs Farugue\\nreported in DLR (4D) 296.\"', '48.  Thus it appears that the High Court Divi-\\nsion correctly considered the scope of sections 81(2)\\nand 85(3) of the Companies Act and also considered\\nRegulation No. 46(2) of the 2003 in its true per-\\nspective.', '49. Itis true that the Company Bench cannot\\ninterfere in the internal management of the Com-\\npany but in the instant case the previous AGMs\\ncould not transect on the important agendas pertain-\\ning to receipt and adoption of Audited Accounts for\\nthe relevant years and approving any dividend as\\nrecommended by BoD as appearing in agenda Nos.\\n1 and 2 in the notice for the 22nnd AGM because of\\nthe injunction issued by the Company Bench and\\ntherefore the matter on those agendas could not be\\ntransected and the Company Bench therefore was\\nmoved under sections 81(2) and 85(3) of the Act and\\nin making the Rule absolute, the High Court\\nDivision appears to have only granted ancillary and\\nconsequential order including those pertaining to\\nfixing Record Date and conducting of 20th, 21st and\\n22nd AGMs on condition that the balance sheet,\\nfinancial statement and audited accounts for the year\\nending will December 31, 2005 is prepared afresh\\nand a new Record Date to be fixed. Since these\\ndirections are ancillary and consequential in nature\\nthe High Court Division committed no illegality in\\nexercising the power under section 85(3) of the Act.\\nI‘t is pen.inent to mention here that Record Date is\\nllnkf:d with the AGMs and it cannot be tied with the\\nc.arher Record Date fixed under the SEC Notifica-\\ntion and the Company Bench rightly considered\\nArticles 137 and 140 of the Company in deciding\\nthe rights of the share-holders.', '‘50. In sExch view of the matter we find that\\nthe impugned judgment suffers from no illegality\\nand calls for no interference by this Court,', 'In the result, all the appeals are dismissed with-\\nout any order as to costs.', 'APPELLATE DIVISION\\n(Criminal)\\nState.........Petitioner <br>\\nZakaria Pintu alias Md Zakaria Pintu and others ........Respondents <br>', 'Md Fazlul Karim CJ | ', 'Md Abdul Matin J | \\nSAN Mominur Rahman J| \\nABM Khairul Haque J | \\nMM Hossain J | \\nSK SinhaJ | \\n<br>\\nJudgment\\nJune 6th 2010.\\nCode of Criminal Procedure (v of 1898)', 'Section 498\\nAnticipatory bail —Not to harass/arrest.

The facts leading to the filing of this peti-\\ntion are the one Md Mokhlesur Rahman lodged an\\nfirst information report on 27-11-2009 with the\\n\\\\shwardi Police Station, alleging inter-alia that due\\n1o carlier enmity, the respondent No. 1 along with 20\\nnamed persons and others being armed with chinese\\naxe, knife, rod, sticks, on the order of respondent\\nNo.l. attacked his two sons namely, Shazal and\\nAzam on 26-11-2009 at about 9-15 PM in the\\nevening, on their way home, that while some of the\\naccused pushed down Azam on the ground, the\\nrespondent No.1, gave a blow on his head with his\\nchinese axe and others also variously assaulted\\nAzam and Shazal, as such, Azam died there while\\nShazal was seriously injured.', '3. The police on receipt of the first infor-\\nmation report, started a case under sections 143/341/\\n3247326/ 307/302/ 34/114 of the Penal Code, which\\nis now pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate,\\nPabna.', '4. It is alleged in the petition before the\\nHigh Court Division that on 28-11-2009, the police\\nraided the houses of the respondents, as such, after\\nobtaining a hand copy of the first information report,\\nfiled a petition under section 498 of the Code of\\nCriminal Procedure, before the High Court Divi-\\nsion, being Criminal Miscellaneous Case No, 27040\\nof 2009, and appeared before the Court in person,\\npraying for anticipatory bail.', '5. The learned Judges of the High Court\\nDivision observed that upon meticulous considera-\\ntion of the facts and circumstances of the case, they\\nare satisfied that the petitioners’ application should\\nbe considered in order to protect the constitutional\\nguarantee of the accused petitioner, and he must not\\nbe victim of any physical abuse.', '\\n6. With these observations, the learned\\nJudges of the High Court Division, issued a Rule\\nupon the State to show-cause as to why the accused\\npetitioner No. | (the respondent No. | herein),\\nshould not be enlarged on anticipatory bail, in con-\\nnection with the case under reference, and in the\\nmeantime, he was enlarged on ad-interim anticipa-\\ntory bail for a period of 6 (six) months or till sub-\\nmission of police report whichever is earlier.', '7.  The learned Judges, however, disposed\\nof the petition of the petitioner Nos. 2-14, with a\\ndirection upon them to surrender before the Sessions\\nJudge, Pabna, within 8 (eight) weeks from date. The\\nlearned Judges also directed the police authority not\\nto arrest the accused petitioner Nos. 2-14 in the\\nmeantime with a further direction upon the Sessions\\nJudge, Pabna, to consider their prayer for bail, if\\npreferred by them.', '8. Being aggrieved by the above Order\\ndated 8-12-2009, passed by the High Court Divi-\\nsion, this petition for leave has been filed on behalf\\nof the State.', '9.  Mr Md Ekramul Haque, the learned\\nAssistant Attorney-General, assails the impugned\\norder mainly on the ground that the leamed Judges\\nof the High Court Division did not exercise their\\njudicial discretion in accordance with law in granti-\\nng anticipatory bail in favour of the respondent\\nNo.1, in the face of the direct allegations of serious\\noffences alleged against him in the first information\\nreport,', '10.  Mr Abdul Majid, the leammed Advocate,\\nappearing on behalf of the respondent No. 1, sup-\\nports the order of the High Court Division, Besides,\\na separate petition has been filed on behalf of the\\naccused-respondents on 20-4-2010, praying for\\nvacating the order dated 27-12-2009, passed by the\\nlearned Judge in Chamber of this Division, staying\\nthe operation of the order dated 8-12-2009 of the\\nHigh Court Division.', '11.  We have heard the learned Advocates of\\nboth the sides, perused the order dated 8-12-2009,\\nand other papers kept in the paper-book.', '            ', '\\n12.  Let me remind all concerned that as\\nSuperior Court of records both the Divisions of the\\nSupreme Court of Bangladesh, enjoy a high degree\\nof discretion in granting reliefs to the litigants but let\\nit be known also if it is not already known that such\\ndiscretion must not be arbitrary but judicial discre-\\ntion, based on established legal principles, handed\\ndown to us over the centuries.', '13.  In the instant case, the first information\\nreport disclosed direct allegations of offences of\\nvery serious nature against the accused-respondent\\nNo.1 and other accused-respondents in which onc\\nperson died and another one seriously injured on 26-\\n11-2009. Naturally, the police tried to apprehend\\nthem but was unsuccessful, yet within 10 (ten) days,\\n14 (fourteen) of them very conveniently appeared\\nbefore the concerned Bench of the High Court\\nDivision and prayed for bail when their initial obli-\\ngation was either to surrender before the police or\\nbefore the concerned Court of Judicial Magistrate.', '14. Instead, all of them, surrendered before\\nthe High Court Division, and prayed for bail which\\nis in common parlance known as anticipatory bail,\\nalthough the question of anticipation did not arise\\nhere since they are admitted fugitives and sure to be\\narrested, in connection with investigation into the\\nallegations contained in the first information report\\nand to bring the offenders before the Court for trial.\\nThese duties are cast upon the police and other law', 'enforcing agencies under the various provisions of\\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, long before the\\nenactment of the Constitution. The Constitution\\nonly strengthened those established legal duties of\\nthe police, so that ordinary law abiding people of\\nBangladesh can run their normal avocation of life\\nwithout being afraid of their life and limb, This\\nsecurity from being killed or molested is not only\\nthe Constitutional right of 150 million ordinary peo-\\np.le of Bangladesh but is happened to be their birth\\nright. The people of Bangladesh has a right to die a\\nnatural peaceful death and not being hacked to death\\nby a chinese axe and other weapons as alleged in\\nthis case.', '15. The Judges are well advised to remem-\\nber this aspect of humanity when they sit on the high', 'altar of justice. They must remember that not anly\\nthe livings appearing before them but the deedy are\\nalso equally seeker of even handed justice before\\nthem and we cannot deprive cither of them,', '16. Let me now consider the impugned\\norder. With great respect, the order passed by the\\nlearned  Judges gives an impression that they did\\nnot even go through the first information report in\\nconsidering the petition for bail. The order does not\\nreflect it at all. It does not state a word about the\\nincident which resulted the death of a human being\\nbut granted bail, an anticipatory one, to the main\\naccused on invoking the Constitutional right of the\\naccused. But it was the first legal duty of the\\naccused persons to surrender cither before the police\\nor before the concerned Magistrate before invoking\\ntheir Constitutional right, although we are not aware\\nof their any other right but the obligation to surren-\\nder as above. After all, the victims also have their\\nvarious rights under the same very Constitution.', '17.  This petition also gives me an opportuni-\\nty to remind all concerned which is sometimes for-\\ngotten that a bail although may often be right to an\\naccused but sometimes it is imperative on the part of\\nthe Court to refuse if there is serious allegations\\nagainst him, like murder, rape, violence etc.,\\nbecause the Court must always keep in mind that\\njustice must ultimately be done by ensuring punish-\\nment upon the offender, otherwise, the offenders\\nwill get upper hand and the sober section of the soci-\\nety will suffer, which will destroy the fabrics of the\\ncivilised society. After all, it is the first and foremost\\nduty of the State to bring the offenders to book in\\norder to ensure justice in the society.', '18. It may be noted that proper investigation\\nis the precondition for ensurlhy dispensation of jus-\\ntice, Mainly for that purpose, when there is allega-\\ntions of serious offence, bail is generally refused. in\\norder to avoid tempering of evidence so that the\\npolice may collect evidence from the witnesses, who\\nmay otherwise be afraid of reprisals. If the witness-\\nes themselves are afraid of their own life and limb or\\nof their near ones, they will never come forward\\nwith the truth against the marauding offenders, it I¢!\\nloose on obtaining bail from the Court. Ultimately:', '            ', '\\nthe administration of criminal justice would collapse\\nand no member of the society will be safe. It must\\nalso be remembered that the fugitives generally do\\nnot come out in the open, out of fear of the police\\nand the public in general but once they are enlarged\\non bail, instead of feeling shy, they without the fear\\nof the police become doubly emboldened, while the\\ninformant and the witnesses take refuge in their\\nhearth and home. The learned Judges would do\\ninjustice to their vow to dispense even handed jus-\\ntice if they give a blind eye to this naked truth of the\\npresent day situation.', '19. In the present case, the learned Judges\\nought to have remembered that anticipatory bail is\\nan extra-ordinary relief and this power should be\\nexercised sparingly, only in an extra-ordinary and\\nexceptional circumstances, not otherwise. The Court\\nmust bear in mind that granting of anticipatory bail\\nis an exception to the general rule.', '20. In this connection, reference may be\\nmade to the stern warning sounded by SA Rahman,\\nJ, in the case of Said Ali vs State, 18 DLR (SC) 393:\\n <br>\\n“In discriminate grant of bail, however,\\nmerely on the request of a person, who appears\\nin Court, and thereby surrenders himself to that\\nCourt, without the other conditions for such bail\\nbeing satisfied, would amount to an act of judi-\\ncial extravagance which cannot be counte-\\nnanced.”', '21. This Division, in the case of State vs\\nAbdul Wahab Shah Chowdhury 51 DLR (AD) 243,\\nconsidered the scope of granting of an anticipatory\\nbail. In that appeal, two cases from the High Court\\nDivision were considered where anticipatory bails\\nwere allowed. In one case, the petitioner was the\\npresident of the local unit of Bangladesh Jatiyat-\\nabadi Juba Dal and in another case, the petitioner\\nabducted his 19 year old cousin, the daughter of his\\naunt. In allowing both the appeals and rejecting the\\nplea of anticipatory bail, ATM Afzal, CJ, explained', 'the principle thus : <br>\\n“20 . Now we come to the real point at issue\\nas to the conditions and circumstances under\\nwhich an application for pre-arrest or anticipa-', '\\ntory bail can be considered under section 498 of\\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure. We wish to lay\\ndown as a first proposition that it is an extraor-\\ndinary remedy, and an exception to the general\\nlaw of bail which can be granted only in\\nextraordinary and exceptional circumstances\\nupon a proper and intelligent exercise of discre-\\ntion. The ordinary law is that a person accused\\nof a non-bailable offence must appear before\\nthe Court taking cognisance for making a\\nprayer for bail. The prayer can be made when\\nhe is arrested or detained with or without war-\\nrant and is brought before the said Court. Pre-\\narrest bail is an exception to the general law...', '\"', '.........................', '22. The learned Chief Justice, referring to\\nthe submissions of the learned Attorney-General\\nheld :\\n <br>\\n“22 . As for the present appeals. the learned\\nAttorney-General has submitted that the facts dis-\\nclosed in the petitions for bail are absolutely no\\ngrounds for even entertaining an application for\\nanticipatory bail. The allegation that the case is false\\nor that the case has been instituted out of political\\nrivalry or the omnibus allegation that the Magis-\\ntrates are being controlled by the ruling party and\\nthe petitioner being a member of the opposition\\nparty has apprehension that his prayer for bail will\\nnot be justly and judicially dealt with are at all no\\ngrounds for granting the extraordinary relief of pre-\\narrest bail. He submits that having regard to the\\ngravity of the offences and the allegations made\\nagainst the petitioners the High Court Division\\nshould have rejected with applications in limine.', '23 .......... While we agree\\nwith the submissions of the learned Attorney-\\nGeneral, we may add that it may often even be\\npossible to successfully make a prayer for bail\\non merit in the facts of a particular case but that\\nalone can never be a ground for granting a\\nprayer for pre-arrest bail. This prayer, extraor-\\ndinary as it is, can only be considered, as\\nalready stated, when it appears to the Court that\\nthe purpose of the alleged proceeding as far as\\nthe accused is concerned, is not what it purports\\nto be, but to achieve a collateral purpose by', '            ', 'abusing the process of law, such as, harassment,\\nhumiliation, etc, of the accused which cannot be\\npermitted.™\\n <br>\\nLatifur Rahman, J (as his Lordship then\\nwas) held the same Views !\\n <br>\\n«40 . On a consideration of these decisions,\\nI hold that ordinarily when a person is wanted\\nin connection with a non-bailable offence of\\ngrave nature he is not entitled to anticipatory\\nbail. All persons charged with non-bailable\\noffences must be treated equally unless, of\\ncourse. there are special circumstances which\\nneed special consideration in particular factof a\\n <br>\\n43 .

In a recent order, passed in the case of\\nthe State vs Hague 15 MLR (AD) 151, this Division,\\nin discouraging indiscriminate granting of anticipa-\\ntory bail, was constrained to discharge a Rule, pend-\\ning before the High Court Division.', '24.  In the present case, there is specific alle-\\ngations of overt acts against the respondents in the\\nfirst information report, as such, there is no scope to\\ngrant anticipatory bail to the respondent No. I,\\nwhether he is a political leader or not,', \"25'. Let me now consider the order passed by\\nthe High Court Division, in respect of other\\naccused-respondents.\", \"26. It appears that the accused-respondent\\nNo's. 2 to 14, instead of surrendering before the\\npolice or before the Court of Judicial Magistrate\\nsurrendered before the High Court Division and'\\nprayed for anticipatory bail.\", '27. The ‘Court, however, did not grant them\\nail, instead, directed them to surrender before the\\nSessions Judge, Pabna, within 8 (eight) weeks and\\nin the meantime, the police is directed not to arrest\\nthem.', '28. This order is also beyond the provisions\\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law\\nknown to us. It should be noted that it is an ofTence\\nto harbour a criminal, rather it is a civic duty, recog-\\nnized all over the world, to hand over a fugitive to\\nthe police. A Court of law cannot be an exception to\\nit. If a fugitive surrenders before the High Court\\nDivision and prays for bail, it may either grant bail\\nunder section 498 of the Code, on the principle dis-\\ncussed above or is obliged to hand him over to the\\npolice, to be dealt with in accordance with law.
